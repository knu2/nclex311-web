The condition occurs when amniotic fluid escapes into maternal circulation through the placental site into the pulmonary arterioles, causing respiratory compromise as the primary symptom.\\n\\n**Priority assessment:** Focus on respiratory system due to pulmonary involvement and dyspnea as the cardinal sign."
