    "key_points": "**CONCEPT: A Pavlik harness helps to keep the legs abducted in developmental dysplasia of the hips (DDH).**\\n\\n**Key Care Instructions:**\\n\\n- **Purpose**: Pavlik harness is used to keep the legs in abduction\\n- **Positioning**: By flexing up the legs and allowing the knees to fall outwards, the hips are held in proper position\\n- **Duration**: The harness is applied to hold the hips and knees up with the legs apart (abducted). It is usually worn for 24 hours for 8-12 weeks\\n- **Bathing**: The removal of the harness for bathing depends on the doctor's recommendation. If it cannot be removed for bathing, sponge bath can be done\\n- **Fit**: The harness strap for the chest and legs should be firm but not too tight. If the child cries incessantly, notify the doctor. This could mean that the harness is too tight\\n- **Clothing**: The baby can wear diapers under the harness. All clothing should be worn over the Pavlik harness. Use hip dysplasia pants with easy snaps over the harness\\n- **Skin Care**: Do not use lotion, powder, ointment under the harness\\n- **Cleaning**: To clean a soiled part of the harness, use water, soap and nail brush. Dry using a hair dryer or blot dry using a towel. Do not tumble dry the harness as it may shrink",
