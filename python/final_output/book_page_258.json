    "key_points": "- NST assesses fetal activity and wellbeing.\n- Inform the client that the test is painless.\n- It will take 20-30 minutes.\n- A fetal monitor will be used.\n- Two belts with two sensors will be worn around the belly. One sensor will monitor the contractions. One sensor will track the babyâ€™s heart rate.\n- The client is instructed to press a button on the device every time they feel the baby move.\n- Reactive test- acceleration of fetal heart rate of more than 15 beats per minute above baseline FHR, lasting for 15 seconds or more.\n- Non-reactive test- acceleration of FHR of less than 15 beats per minute above baseline FHR may indicate fetal jeopardy.",
