        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nRadioactive iodine is highly toxic. Therefore, any materials that might have been contaminated by this drug should be handled carefully.\\n\\nSince urine is the major source of contamination for clients treated with radioactive iodine 131, bedpans and urinals require careful handling. Linens may also become contaminated through contact with the client or contaminated body fluids. Blood and sputum are not primary sources of contamination with radioactive iodine 131."
