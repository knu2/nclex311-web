The electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing characterized by the presence of irregular QRS with indiscernible P waves on the ECG, is reflected below.\\n\\n![ECG Tracing showing atrial fibrillation](atrial_fibrillation_question_ecg.png)\\n\\n**Which two possible conditions can the nurse infer from the client's history?**",

        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nAccording to the American Heart Association (AHA), atrial fibrillation, the most common arrhythmia, and atrial flutter, the second most common arrhythmia, have essentially the same risk factors, symptoms, and treatment. The risk for having atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter increases with age.\\n\\nTo answer the question correctly, focus on the syndrome \"presence of irregular QRS with indiscernible P waves on the ECG of an elderly with frequent orthostatic hypotension described as frequent dizziness when standing from a lying down position.\" The f-waves or \"the indiscernible P waves\" are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulses are fired by the atria in an irregular manner, leading to an irregular heart rhythm.\\n\\nAtrial flutter is characterized by fast but regular rhythm. The P waves are replaced by F waves. The resulting ECG tracing is described as \"saw-tooth\" pattern.\\n\\nIn both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, the atria beat faster but it occurs in an irregular manner in atrial fibrillation, and regular manner in atrial flutter.\\n\\nThe table below differentiates the two types of arrhythmias:\\n\\n| Feature | Atrial fibrillation | Atrial flutter |\\n|---------|---------------------|----------------|\\n| ECG tracing | ![Atrial Fibrillation ECG](atrial_fibrillation_ecg_tracing.png) | ![Atrial Flutter ECG](atrial_flutter_ecg_tracing.png) |\\n| Rhythm | Irregular | Regular |\\n| Atrial rate | 400-600 bpm | 250-400 bpm |\\n| QRS complex | Normal | Normal |\\n| P wave | not distinguishable<br>replaced with smaller \"f\" waves | replaced with larger \"f\" waves |\\n| PR interval | Not measurable | Not measurable |"
