        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nTheophylline (Theo-dur) causes bronchodilation, whereas chamomile causes bronchoconstriction. They are antagonistic with each other, hence they should not be taken at the same time.\\n\\n**Mechanism of Interaction:**\\n- **Theophylline**: Bronchodilator - opens airways\\n- **Chamomile**: Causes bronchospasm - constricts airways\\n- **Antagonistic effects**: Work against each other\\n\\n**Clinical Significance:**\\n- This combination could reduce the effectiveness of theophylline\\n- May worsen respiratory symptoms in patients with asthma or COPD\\n- Patients should be specifically counseled about this interaction\\n\\n**Note**: The extracted answer from the source shows '2', but based on the medical rationale provided (chamomile causes bronchospasm, antagonistic to theophylline), the logical answer should be chamomile (option 1). This may represent an error in the source material."
