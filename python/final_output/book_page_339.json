Therefore, vegetarians are Vitamin B12-deficient because they do not eat any animal products.\n\n**Key nutritional considerations:**\n- **Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)** is primarily found in animal products (meat, dairy, eggs)\n- **Vegans exclude all animal products** from their diet, creating risk for deficiency\n- **Pernicious anemia** can develop from prolonged B12 deficiency\n- **Vegetables are rich in vitamin B9 (folacin)** but deficient in B12\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- **Vitamin C** - abundant in fruits and vegetables consumed by vegans\n- **Vitamin A** - available in plant sources as beta-carotene\n- **Vitamin K** - found in green leafy vegetables consumed by vegans"
