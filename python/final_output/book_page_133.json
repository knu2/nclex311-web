        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nA decrease in the pulse rate indicates blocking of the autonomic nervous system, the expected effect of methimazole (Tapazole).\\n\\nMethimazole works by blocking the sympathetic nervous system response that is heightened in hyperthyroidism. Tachycardia is a hallmark sign of hyperthyroidism, so a decreasing pulse rate is a key indicator that the medication is effectively reducing thyroid hormone effects on the cardiovascular system."
