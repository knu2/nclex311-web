    "key_points": "**DIC** is characterized by widespread coagulation all over the body resulting in subsequent depletion of clotting factors.\\n\\n- **Manifestations**: It is characterized by petechiae and ecchymosis on the skin, mucous membrane, heart, lungs and other organs\\n- **Monitoring**: Monitor for signs of bleeding (e.g. tarry stool, hemoptysis and nose bleeding)\\n- **Medication**: Administer heparin as ordered. Heparin inhibits thrombin thus preventing further clot formation and allowing coagulation factors to accumulate\\n- **Supportive Care**: Administer blood transfusion as ordered\\n- **Patient Education**: Instruct the client to avoid aspirin or aspirin-containing compounds",
