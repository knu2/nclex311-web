    "key_points": "In preparation for polysomnography assess the following:\\n\\n**CONCEPT**: Polysomnography or sleep test involves measurement of:\\n- **Breathing**\\n- **Oxygen saturation**\\n- **Brain waves (electroencephalography)**\\n- **Heart rhythm (electrocardiogram)**\\n- **Eye movement (electrooculogram)**\\n- **Limb movement (electromyography)**\\n\\n**Technical details:**\\n- It measures brain waves, oxygen levels, heart rate, breathing patterns, eye movements, and muscle activity\\n- Conducted overnight in a sleep lab, the test involves attaching electrodes to monitor these parameters\\n- Clients should avoid caffeine, alcohol, and naps on the day of the test and follow their normal bedtime routines\\n- Results are analyzed by a sleep specialist to determine the presence and severity of sleep disorders, guiding treatment plans\\n\\n**Procedure specifics:**\\n- Polysomnography involves electroencephalography (EEG) that entails the use of electrodes (stickers) attached to the head\\n- It also involves electromyography (EMG) in which electrodes are attached to the skin of the limbs\\n- Electrodes are also attached outside the eyes to measure eye movement\\n- In some sleep studies acid/base balance in the stomach is also measured\\n- Avoid using lotion, as the electrodes may not stick on the skin with lotion\\n- Monitoring and video recording will start before the client sleeps\\n- The lights will be turned off\\n- During the test a microphone is set up to monitor snoring\\n- Belts around the chest and abdomen are used to monitor breathing\\n- A nasal cannula is used to monitor the airflow\\n- Videos are also used to record movement\\n\\n**Pre-test instructions:**\\n- Daytime naps should be avoided before the procedure as it may interfere with sleep\\n- Caffeine-containing products should also be avoided several days before the test as it may interfere with sleep",

        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nAn allergy test is not a requirement for a polysomnogram as it does not involve administration of allergy-causing contrast medium.\\n\\nA sedative may interfere with the validity of the test results as it can alter brain activity. It is not given before the test.\\n\\n**Analysis of correct statements:**\\n\\n1. \"I will have stickers on my face and head.\" - CORRECT: Electrodes (stickers) are attached to the head for EEG monitoring.\\n\\n4. \"The video recording will begin even before I sleep.\" - CORRECT: Monitoring and video recording start before the client sleeps.\\n\\n5. \"I will need to avoid taking a daytime nap before the test.\" - CORRECT: Daytime naps should be avoided as they may interfere with sleep during the test.\\n\\n6. \"The test will measure my snoring.\" - CORRECT: A microphone is set up to monitor snoring.\\n\\n7. \"My eye movements will be measured during the test.\" - CORRECT: Electrodes are attached outside the eyes to measure eye movement (electrooculogram)."
