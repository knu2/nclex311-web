        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\n\nCardiac output increases by 25-30% with an increase in uterine flow when the woman turns from her back to lateral position, thereby preventing supine hypotensive syndrome.\n\n**Why Option 3 is correct (Place the client on her left side):**\n- **Immediate intervention**: Relieves compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus\n- **Physiologic benefit**: Improves venous return to the heart\n- **Cardiac output**: Increases by 25-30% when turning from supine to lateral position\n- **Uterine perfusion**: Increases blood flow to the uterus and placenta\n- **Safety**: Safe, immediate, and effective intervention that can be performed by any nurse\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- **Option 1** (Refer to physician): Delays immediate treatment; positioning should be done first\n- **Option 2** (Monitor BP q2-4h): Monitoring is important but doesn't address the immediate problem\n- **Option 4** (Trendelenburg): May worsen the compression and is not appropriate for pregnant clients with SHS\n\n**Clinical Priority**: The priority is immediate relief of the underlying cause (vena cava compression) through proper positioning, not just monitoring or referral."
