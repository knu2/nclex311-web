        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nAortic patency is best heard in the 2nd intercostal space, right sternal border.\\n\\nThis location corresponds to the aortic area where aortic valve sounds are most audible. The aortic valve closes during diastole, creating the S2 heart sound, and any abnormalities in aortic function (such as stenosis or regurgitation) are best detected at this anatomical location.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the location of heart sounds do not correspond to the anatomic location of the valves within the chest, but rather to where the sounds are best transmitted and heard."
