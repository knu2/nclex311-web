        "correct_answer": "1",
        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nAn increase in the specific gravity of the urine indicates the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine, which is a positive outcome of the use of vasopressin (Pitressin).\\n\\nDiabetes insipidus results from insufficient antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urine production and dilute urine. Vasopressin acts as synthetic ADH, promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys and producing more concentrated urine with higher specific gravity."
