She calls an unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) a \"slave of the royal court\" and orders her to bring her luggage to her room and have her clothes ready for the \"royal dinner.\" She tells the UAP that she wants a red silk gown with a green cape that should come with a \"golden pair of Louis Vuitton shoes.\" She states, \"I am the future Queen of England.\"\\n\\nMr. Turner says his wife has spent the last three days shopping and has not slept for three nights. The husband describes that her wife's behavior is similar to what the physician told him about a \"severe major manic attack.\" Prior to this, his wife appeared \"sad, empty and hopeless.\"\\n\\n**Which two possible conditions can the nurse infer from the client's history?**",

        "correct_answer": "3, 4",
        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nTo answer the question correctly, focus on the phrases \"severe major manic attack\" and \"sad, empty and hopeless.\" The extreme emotion of severe manic episode with depression is characteristic of bipolar 1 disorder. In bipolar 1, there is an imbalance between the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, which leads to disruption of mood regulation.\\n\\nIn bipolar disorders there are alternating episodes of mania and depression. Bipolar 1 and 2 differ in the severity of the manic episodes. Bipolar 1 disorder is characterized by severe manic episode or hypomanic episodes with major depression; while bipolar 2 disorder is characterized by less severe manic episodes (hypomania) with at least one major depressive episode. Thus, severe manic episode is the criterion that differentiate bipolar 1 from bipolar 2 disorder.\\n\\n**Medication Management:**\\n\\nThe medications for bipolar disorders include lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics. An anticonvulsant is given to calm the client with bipolar disorder; this includes carbamazepine (Tegretol), divalproex (Depakote), gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and lamotrigine (Lamictal); these medications may cause agranulocytosis, so notify the healthcare provider for the development of a rash and sore throat. Antipsychotics may be given to a client with bipolar disorder to calm the client immediately, as lithium is slow-acting and typically has an effect after 10–14 days. The nurse should monitor for improved appetite and sleep after the intake of antipsychotics. The nurse should also notify the health care provider (HCP) of the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome as indicated by a temperature above 38.5 °C."
