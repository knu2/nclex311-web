    "key_points": "**Complete Heart Block (Third-Degree AV Block)**\\n\\n- **Definition**: Complete heart block is due to altered transmission of wave impulses from the SA node to the AV node\\n- **ECG Finding**: ECG reveals prolonged PR interval (more than 0.20 seconds)\\n- **Treatment**: Atropine sulfate is used in complete heart block where the ECG reveals prolonged PR interval\\n- **Monitoring**: Monitor the client's ECG\\n- **Intervention**: Prepare the client for pacemaker insertion\\n- **Complication**: A common sign of pacemaker failure is hiccups\\n- **Pharmacology**: Atropine sulfate is given as a vagolytic to increase the heart rate",

        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nAn ECG tracing with a PR interval of 0.32 seconds is indicative of complete heart block; hence, the nurse should anticipate that the doctor will order atropine SO4, an anticholinergic drug, to increase the heart rate."
