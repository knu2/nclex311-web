        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\n\nContractions that occur at regular intervals associated with progressive cervical dilatation are characteristics of true labor.\n\n**True Labor Contraction Characteristics (Correct Options):**\n- **Option 1** (Occurs at regular intervals): True labor contractions follow a predictable pattern with consistent timing\n- **Option 5** (Unaffected by walking): True labor contractions continue regardless of maternal activity or position changes\n- **Option 10** (Results to progressive cervical dilatation): The hallmark of true labor is progressive cervical changes (effacement and dilatation)\n\n**False Labor/Braxton Hicks Characteristics (Incorrect Options):**\n- **Option 2** (Interval increases): False labor has irregular intervals\n- **Option 3** (Intensity decreases): True labor intensity increases, false labor may decrease\n- **Option 4** (Located in groin): False labor is typically felt in the groin; true labor is felt in the back\n- **Option 6** (Relieved by sedation): False labor can be relieved by rest or mild sedation\n- **Option 7** (No effacement): False labor does not cause cervical changes\n- **Option 8** (Irregular intervals): This describes false labor\n- **Option 9** (Same intensity): False labor maintains the same intensity\n\n**Clinical Assessment**: Nurses must assess contraction pattern, intensity, duration, frequency, and most importantly, cervical changes to differentiate true from false labor."
