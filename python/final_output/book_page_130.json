        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nRosiglitazone (Avandia) is an antidiabetic agent that stimulates insulin receptor sites to lower blood glucose and improve the action of insulin. Therefore, blood sugar levels should be monitored carefully.\\n\\nAs a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic medication, rosiglitazone works by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to assess therapeutic effectiveness and prevent hypoglycemia."
