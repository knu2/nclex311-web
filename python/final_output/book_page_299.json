        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nThe point of maximum impulse is located on the 5th intercostal space, left midclavicular line.\\n\\nThis anatomical location represents the apex of the heart where the apical pulse is most easily palpated and auscultated. The point of maximum impulse (PMI) is where the left ventricle touches the chest wall during systolic contraction, making it the ideal location for obtaining an accurate apical pulse.\\n\\nThe apical pulse is particularly important when assessing heart rate and rhythm, especially in patients with irregular heart rhythms or when peripheral pulses may be difficult to obtain. The 5th intercostal space, left midclavicular line provides the most reliable access to cardiac activity at the heart's apex."
