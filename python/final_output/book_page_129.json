        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nRegular insulin peak is in 2 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia that occurs before lunch coincides with the peak of the regular insulin.\\n\\nWhen regular insulin is administered in the morning, its peak action occurs 2-6 hours later, which typically falls before the lunch meal. This timing makes before lunch the most likely time for hypoglycemic symptoms to occur, as glucose levels drop during the insulin's peak effectiveness period."
