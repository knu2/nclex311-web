        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nThe presence of only 3 contractions in 5 minutes indicates that the average duration of each contraction is 100 seconds, which is beyond the normal duration.\\n\\nThe normal duration of contractions is 30-90 seconds. Any contraction that lasts longer than 90 seconds may possibly cause uterine rupture and fetal hypoxia, making this client the priority for assessment."
