These altered responses reinforce the need for the nurse to monitor older clients closely and be alert to signs of impending systemic complications. Fatigue and anorexia are two of the early signs of infection in the elderly.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Inflammatory response in the elderly is delayed\n- Traditional signs (fever, redness, swelling) may not appear initially\n- Fatigue and anorexia are often the first indicators\n- Mental status changes may also occur early\n- Nurses must monitor elderly clients closely for subtle changes"
