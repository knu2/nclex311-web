        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nBlue cohosh has an oxytoxic effect, hence it is used during the last few weeks of pregnancy in order to give the uterus final toning.\\n\\n**Mechanism of Action:**\\n- **Oxytoxic effect**: Similar to oxytocin, causing uterine contractions\\n- **Uterine toning**: Prepares the uterus for labor by strengthening muscle tone\\n- **Late pregnancy use**: Specifically used in the last 2-4 weeks before delivery\\n\\n**Clinical Rationale:**\\n- **Option 1 (Correct)**: Final uterine toning is the primary use in late pregnancy\\n- **Option 2**: Cervical closure is not the intended effect of blue cohosh\\n- **Option 3**: Menstruation regulation is used outside of pregnancy\\n- **Option 4**: While blue cohosh can help with bleeding, the primary late-pregnancy use is uterine toning\\n\\n**Safety Considerations:**\\n- Should only be used under proper guidance\\n- Timing is critical - used specifically in late pregnancy\\n- Oxytoxic effects make it effective for labor preparation"
