Severe pain is the hallmark symptom and often the first indication of this complication.\\n\\n**CAPS Assessment for Perineal Hematoma:**\\n- **C**omplaints of pressure and pain\\n- **A**bsence of lochial flow\\n- **P**ossible decrease in blood pressure\\n- **S**kin that is discolored and painful to touch (first sign)\\n\\n**Clinical significance:** Early recognition of severe perineal pain allows for prompt intervention before complications develop."
