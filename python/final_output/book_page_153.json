        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nIn HHS or HHNK, insulin deficiency leads to excessively elevated blood sugar and hyperosmolarity, leading to profound dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological dysfunction.\\n\\nNote that in HHS or HHNK there is no acidosis. Thus, the pH is usually equal to or above 7.30. Blood sugar levels are also higher. Thus, the osmolality is higher. The bicarbonate is below normal and the blood glucose level is above 600 mg/dL, as reflected in the laboratory results.\\n\\nHypokalemia may result from polyuria that occurs in HHS or HHNK, although it is less severe than what occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Thus, monitoring potassium levels is an essential intervention.\\n\\nHypernatremia may also develop due to fluid loss; thus sodium levels must be monitored.\\n\\nThe management of HHS or HHNK includes a combination of rehydration, restoring electrolytes, and lowering the blood sugar level.\\n\\nThe first line of treatment for HHS or HHNK state involves rapid and aggressive volume replacement. This is the highest priority. The fluid of choice is isotonic sodium chloride solution.\\n\\nInsulin administered intravenously is also necessary to normalize the blood sugar levels. The glucose levels must be monitored hourly as the rapid administration of fluids can cause a sudden drop in blood glucose levels.\\n\\nIntravascular volume depletion occurs in HHS or HHNK increasing blood viscosity. This increases the risk for venous thrombosis. To prevent venous thrombosis, administer heparin.\\n\\n**Ray's NGN Tip:** The highest priority in the treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the intravenous administration of 1,000 ml of 0.9 NaCl in the first 1-2 hours of treatment of the client."
