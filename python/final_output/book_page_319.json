This is a serious postpartum complication that can lead to pulmonary embolism if not treated promptly.\\n\\n**Normal vs. abnormal findings:**\\n- Bright red vaginal discharge (lochia rubra) is normal immediately postpartum\\n- After pains are normal uterine contractions during involution\\n- Leukocytosis is expected postpartum due to stress response\\n- **Pain on dorsiflexion = ABNORMAL and requires immediate attention**"
