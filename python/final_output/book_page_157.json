    "key_points": "In a client with obstructive sleep apnea assess the following:\\n\\n**CONCEPT**: Daytime fatigue frequently occurs in clients with obstructive sleep apnea characterized as:\\n- **Male**\\n- **Obese**\\n- **Smoker**\\n- **Thick neck** (greater than 17 inches in circumference)\\n\\n**Clinical presentation:**\\nThe syndrome of loud snoring, choking during sleep, and daytime sleepiness is characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea. In obstructive sleep apnea, airway obstruction occurs during sleep, leading to repeated pauses in breathing and oxygen deprivation.\\n\\n**Signs and symptoms include:**\\n- Loud snoring\\n- Waking during the night choking or gasping\\n- Excessive daytime sleepiness\\n- Observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep\\n- Awakening in the morning with dry mouth or sore throat\\n- Morning headaches\\n- Trouble focusing during the day\\n- Mood changes\\n- High blood pressure\\n- Decreased interest in sex\\n\\n**The complications of obstructive sleep apnea include:**\\n- Hypertension\\n- Stroke\\n- Diabetes\\n- Daytime fatigue\\n- Cognitive impairment\\n- Glaucoma\\n- Accidents\\n\\n**Management includes:**\\n- **Lifestyle changes**: losing weight, avoiding smoking\\n- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy** - most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in adults\\n- **Positioning**: client positioned to the side, as obstructive sleep apnea is more prominent in supine position\\n- **Oral appliances**: such as mandibular advancement device to bring lower jaw forward and relieve airway obstruction\\n- **Surgery**: uvulopalatoplasty - removal of uvula and tissue from soft palate for more space in oropharynx\\n\\n**Discharge instructions:**\\n- Lifestyle modifications (losing weight, medication compliance for antihypertensive and diabetes treatment)\\n- Avoiding smoking\\n- Avoiding alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and antidepressants as these may worsen obstructive sleep apnea\\n- Regular follow-up checkup",

          "1. A 17-year-old male who weighs 110 pounds and spends three hours playing games on his MacBook Pro",
          "2. A 45-year-old male office clerk who weighs 210 pounds at 5' feet flat who alternates smoking Marlboro cigarettes with finger twisting his Bic ball pen while seated on his desk all day",

        "correct_answer": "2",
        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\\n\\nThe client is obese with a BMI of 41.0 (210 pounds at 5 feet tall), smokes, and leads a sedentary lifestyle. These factors put him at risk for conditions like obstructive sleep apnea, which is a significant contributor to daytime fatigue.\\n\\nTo answer the question correctly, identify the risk factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea in the client described in each option. Note that daytime fatigue is a complication of obstructive sleep apnea which can potentially affect safety of the client.\\n\\n\"A 45-year-old male office clerk who weighs 210 pounds at 5' feet flat who alternates smoking Marlboro cigarettes with finger twisting his Bic ball pen while seated on his desk all day\" implies that the client has a sedentary life style, is obese, and a smoker. These are risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea.\\n\\n**Analysis of other options:**\\n\\n1. A 17-year-old male who weighs 110 pounds and spends three hours playing games on his MacBook Pro. This behavior is expected of a teen-ager of his generation.\\n\\n2. A 47-year-old female who weighs 190 pounds at 5' feet flat who frequently complains nausea, vomiting, and right upper abdominal pain after meals. This client is showing risk factors and signs associated with cholelithiasis, a stone in the gallbladder.\\n\\n3. A 61-year-old female who complains of tremors if she misses on her nightly glass of Jim Beam after dinner. This client is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal."
