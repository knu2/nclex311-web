        "question_text": "Which of the following observations indicate that abdominal paracentesis was effective?",
        "options": ["1. Respiratory rate decreases from 36 to 20 per minute.", "2. Protein level decreases from 6.5 mg/dL to 5 mg/dL.", "3. Urine specific gravity increases from 1.016 to 1.030.", "4. Blood pressure decreases from 140/60 to 120/60."],
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "rationale": "**RATIONALE** Massive ascites may cause abdominal discomfort and dyspnea due to pressure exerted by the fluid against the diaphragm. Hence, a decreased respiratory rate is an indication that the client's diaphragm is able to expand."
