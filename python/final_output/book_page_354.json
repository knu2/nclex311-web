    "key_points": "**Assessing Gastric Residual**\n\n- Gastric residual is measured before each intermittent feeding and every 4 to 8 hours for continuous feedings\n- McClave et.al. (1992) suggested that a residual volume of 200 mL or less in a client with nasogastric tubes or a residual volume of 100 mL for clients with gastrostomy tube may indicate feeding intolerance\n- **Normal gastric residual**: should be less than 50% of the total amount of tube feedings\n- The NGT is removed when bowel peristalsis returns",

        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\n\nA normal gastric residual should be less than 50% of the total amount of tube feedings. The nurse could therefore administer the next feeding when the gastric residual is 80 ml, which is less than 50% of 200 mL."
