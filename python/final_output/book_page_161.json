A 40-year-old client with sharp, severe pain due to a renal stone, not relieved by analgesics - This represents severe pain from renal calculi, which is expected but not immediately life-threatening.\\n\\n3. A 40-year-old client with cholelithiasis complaining of right sided abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder blade - This is typical pain pattern for cholelithiasis (gallstones), expected but not an emergency.\\n\\n4. A client with ulcerative colitis having left lower abdominal pain accompanied by bloody diarrhea - This represents expected symptoms of ulcerative colitis exacerbation, requiring management but not immediate intervention.\\n\\n**Clinical reasoning:**\\nPulmonary embolism is a life-threatening complication that can occur in clients with fractures, especially long bone fractures like the femur. The sharp chest pain in this context represents a medical emergency requiring immediate assessment and intervention to prevent respiratory failure and potential death."
