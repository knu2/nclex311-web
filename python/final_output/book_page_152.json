His co-worker who called 911 tells the nurse that he found the client \"slumped on the dining table\" near the pantry at their office.\\n\\nInitial assessment reveals rapid and deep breathing, acetone breath. Laboratory data reflect a blood sugar of 450 mg/dL, a serum potassium level of 2.8 mEq/L, and a serum pH of 6.90.\\n\\n**Which of the following interventions is the highest priority of the nurse?**",

All the other options are appropriate interventions but the highest priority of the nurse is to address the dehydration which is the main problem of the client. Even if the blood sugar of the client is normalized, it will not necessarily reverse the dehydration."
