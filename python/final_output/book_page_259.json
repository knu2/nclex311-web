    "key_points": "- An elevated alpha-fetoprotein level (>30 mg/dL) indicates the presence of neural tube defects.\n- A negative contraction stress test indicates that the fetal heart rate remains normal during uterine contraction.\n- A positive nonstress test indicates a reactive fetus.\n- An increase in glucose in the urine of a pregnant client can be due to accidental spilling of glucose in the urine during pregnancy.",
