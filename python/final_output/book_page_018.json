Initial assessment reveals rigid abdomen. Pain is present and brownish vaginal discharge is also noted.\n\n**Classify the interventions to be implemented by the nurse by putting a check on the appropriate area on the table.**",

        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\n\nTo answer the question correctly, focus on the syndrome \"abdominal rigidity with dark-red vaginal discharge.\" The syndrome of abdominal rigidity (painful) with dark-red vaginal discharge is characteristic of abruptio placenta. In abruptio placenta, the placenta separates early prior to the delivery of the fetus.\n\nTo avoid pressure on the vena cava from the pregnant uterus, the client should be placed on lateral position and not supine. This will help prevent supine hypotensive syndrome.\n\nAbdominal and vaginal examination are not done to prevent worsening of the bleeding.\n\nMonitoring of maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate are needed to establish baseline data.\n\nThe management of abruptio placenta also includes intravenous therapy and the placement of external monitoring equipment, and the client may require cesarean delivery. The client may also need blood transfusion. During blood transfusion, the nurse should assess for manifestations of hypervolemia, such as distended neck veins and lung crackles. These should be reported to the healthcare provider."
