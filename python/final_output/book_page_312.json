        "correct_answer": "4",
        "rationale": "**RATIONALE**\n\nUrinary incontinence is usually due to weakened vaginal muscle. Kegel's exercises will help prevent incontinence by strengthening the vaginal muscles.\n\n**Why Option 4 is correct (To prevent urinary incontinence):**\n- **Primary purpose**: The main goal of Kegel's exercises is to prevent urinary incontinence\n- **Mechanism**: Strengthens the pubococcygeal muscle that supports bladder control\n- **Postpartum relevance**: Childbirth can weaken pelvic floor muscles, leading to incontinence\n- **Evidence-based**: Proven effective for preventing and treating stress urinary incontinence\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- **Option 1** (Promote uterine contraction): Kegel's exercises target pelvic floor muscles, not uterine muscles\n- **Option 2** (Strengthen pelvic muscles): While true, this is the mechanism, not the primary clinical purpose\n- **Option 3** (Prevent UTI): Kegel's exercises do not directly prevent urinary tract infections\n\n**Clinical Teaching**: Clients should be taught to identify the correct muscles by stopping urine flow mid-stream, then practice regular contractions to maintain pelvic floor strength."
