## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed

### Issue: Incorrect Pricing in Xendit Invoice

**Problem:**
- Xendit invoice showed **PHP 20,000.00** instead of **PHP 200.00**
- Expected monthly price is ₱200, not ₱20,000

**Root Cause:**
- Database stores amounts in **centavos** (20000 = ₱200.00)
- Xendit Invoice API expects amounts in **whole currency units** (200.00 PHP)
- Code was sending 20000 directly to Xendit, which interpreted it as ₱20,000

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// File: apps/web/src/lib/xendit.ts (line 178)

// Xendit Invoice API expects amount in whole currency units (PHP), not centavos
// Our database stores amounts in centavos (20000 = ₱200.00)
// Xendit expects: 200.00 for ₱200
const amountInPHP = amount / 100;
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Test invoice correctly shows PHP 200.00
- ✅ Payment charged correct amount
- ✅ Annual pricing would show PHP 1,920.00 (from 192000 centavos)

## ⚠️ Known Issue: Session Refresh

### Issue Description
After successful payment and webhook processing, the user's premium subscription is not immediately reflected in the UI. Chapters 5-8 still show "Upgrade to access" even though the database confirms `subscription_status = 'premium'`.

### Root Cause
NextAuth session callback (`auth-utils.ts` lines 75-81) only includes user ID and email in the session. It doesn't fetch subscription data from the database.

```typescript
// Current session callback (incomplete)
async session({ session, token }) {
  if (token && session.user && token.sub) {
    (session.user as { id?: string }).id = token.sub;
  }
  return session;
}
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** Low (UX inconvenience, not a data issue)
- **Workaround:** User must logout and login to see premium access
- **Data Integrity:** ✅ Subscription is correctly activated in database
- **Payment Processing:** ✅ No impact on payment flow

### Recommended Fix (Deferred)
```typescript
async session({ session, token }) {
  if (token?.sub) {
    // Fetch fresh user data including subscription
    const userData = await fetchUserWithSubscription(token.sub);
    session.user.id = token.sub;
    session.user.subscriptionStatus = userData.subscription_status;
    session.user.subscriptionExpiresAt = userData.subscription_expires_at;
  }
  return session;
}
```

**Status:** Deferred to separate story/task  
**Blocks Production:** No - subscription activation works correctly
