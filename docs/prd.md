# NCLEX311-Web Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Launch a fully functional, mobile-first, interactive web application for NCLEX 311 within 4 months.
*   Acquire 5,000 registered free-tier users within the first 6 months after launch.
*   Achieve a 5% conversion rate from free users to premium subscribers within the first year.
*   Establish the platform as the top-rated digital NCLEX review tool in the Philippines.
*   Provide an engaging, personalized, and convenient learning experience.
*   Offer interactive questions with instant feedback and detailed rationales.
*   Allow users to track progress and bookmark concepts.
*   Foster a community through commenting and sharing success stories.

### Background Context

The current NCLEX 311 content exists as a static printed book, which lacks interactivity, accessibility, and personalization. This project aims to transform the "NCLEX 311 QuickFixÂ® Edition" book into a modern, mobile-first, interactive web application. The platform will solve the limitations of the print format by offering a dynamic and engaging learning tool for nursing students and professionals preparing for the NCLEX-RN exam, primarily targeting aspiring nurses in the Philippines and overseas.

The platform will be built on a freemium model, providing free access to a portion of the content to showcase its value and offering full access via an annual subscription. This will create a more efficient, engaging, and supportive study process, ultimately boosting user confidence and preparedness for the NCLEX-RN examination.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create a modern, mobile-first, and highly intuitive web application that transforms the static NCLEX 311 content into a dynamic and engaging learning experience. The platform should feel encouraging and supportive, empowering users to study effectively anytime, anywhere.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Interactive Quizzing:** A simple, clear interface for answering multiple-choice questions with immediate visual feedback (correct/incorrect) and one-click access to detailed rationales.
*   **Concept Navigation:** Easy browsing and searching of all 323 concepts, with clear indicators for free vs. premium content.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Content and options are revealed contextually to avoid overwhelming the user. For example, rationales are shown only after a question is answered.
*   **One-Click Bookmarking:** A simple, persistent toggle to save or unsave a concept for later review from the dashboard.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Login/Sign-Up Screen:** A clean and simple form for user authentication (implemented with MUI components).
*   **Sidebar Navigation:** Persistent navigation panel showing current chapter's concepts with completion indicators (desktop: always visible; mobile: drawer).
*   **Concept/Quiz Viewer:** Single-scroll interface with "READ THIS" content section, visual arrow transition, and "ANSWER THIS" quiz section with inline feedback.
*   **All Chapters View:** Grid-based overview of all 8 chapters with progress visualization and free/premium indicators.
*   **Progress Dashboard:** Detailed chapter-by-chapter progress tracking with animated progress bars and completed concepts lists.
*   **Bookmarks View:** Grid of bookmarked concepts with personal notes display and quick-action buttons.
*   **Notes Modal:** Full-screen overlay for personal note-taking with character limit and tips section.
*   **Discussion Modal:** Community discussion interface with instructor posts, student replies, and engagement features.
*   **Subscription/Upgrade Page:** Clear and secure page for premium upgrade, integrated with Maya Business.
*   **User Profile/Settings Page:** Basic page for managing account details.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

To ensure the application is usable by the widest possible audience, we will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. This was assumed as a best practice for a modern educational platform.

### Branding

The application should incorporate the branding of the established Ray A. Gapuz review system to leverage its authority and trust. Specific brand guidelines (logos, color palette, typography) need to be provided.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a fully responsive web app, ensuring a seamless and optimized experience across all modern desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

A monorepo is recommended to house the unified Next.js application and the separate PDF parsing utility, simplifying project management.

### Service Architecture: Integrated (Next.js)

Since the complex PDF parsing will be handled by a separate one-time script, the application's backend requirements (auth, payments, data APIs) are streamlined. Therefore, we will use an **integrated architecture where the Next.js framework handles both the frontend and the backend API routes**. This simplifies development, deployment, and maintenance.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

The testing strategy will focus on a combination of unit tests for individual components (React components, API routes) and integration tests for key user workflows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Application Framework:** **Next.js** will be used for both the frontend and backend, providing a unified React-based development experience.
*   **PDF Parsing Utility:** A **separate, one-time utility will be built in Python** to perform the initial database seeding from the source PDF. This is a temporary tool, not part of the deployed application.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** remains the recommended database.
*   **API:** The backend API will be implemented using **Next.js API Routes**.
*   **Deployment:** The Next.js application will be deployed on a cloud platform optimized for it, such as **Vercel**, or a major provider like **AWS** or **Google Cloud**.
*   **Payment Gateway:** The system will exclusively use the **Maya Business API**.
