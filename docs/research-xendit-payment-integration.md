# Research Prompt: Xendit Payment Gateway Integration for Philippine NCLEX Platform

## Research Objective

Investigate Xendit payment gateway integration requirements, implementation approaches, and compliance considerations for a Philippine-registered business serving Philippine-based users for an NCLEX study platform.

## Background Context

- **Business**: Philippine-registered company
- **User Base**: Primarily Philippine-based NCLEX exam candidates
- **Current State**: No payment gateway currently implemented
- **Platform**: Full-stack web application (likely Next.js/React frontend, backend API)
- **Epic 2 Focus**: Payment processing for course/study materials purchases

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **What are Xendit's integration options for Philippine businesses?**
   - REST API vs SDK implementations
   - Supported payment methods (cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, installments)
   - Authentication and security requirements

2. **What are the compliance and regulatory requirements?**
   - BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) regulations
   - PCI-DSS compliance responsibilities
   - Data residency and privacy requirements (Philippine Data Privacy Act)
   - Tax implications (VAT, withholding tax)

3. **What is the technical implementation approach?**
   - Server-side vs client-side integration patterns
   - Webhook handling for payment notifications
   - Testing environments and sandbox availability
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

4. **What are the costs and business considerations?**
   - Transaction fees structure
   - Settlement timelines
   - Minimum/maximum transaction limits
   - Currency support (PHP primary)

5. **What are the integration dependencies and prerequisites?**
   - Business verification requirements
   - API credentials and onboarding process
   - Development tools and documentation quality
   - Support channels and SLA

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

1. How does Xendit compare to other Philippine payment gateways (PayMongo, Paynamics)?
2. What are common implementation challenges and gotchas?
3. Are there reference implementations or code examples for similar platforms?
4. What monitoring and analytics capabilities does Xendit provide?
5. How does Xendit handle refunds, disputes, and chargebacks?
6. What is the user experience flow for different payment methods?

## Research Methodology

### Information Sources
- Xendit official documentation and developer guides
- Xendit API reference and integration guides
- Philippine BSP regulations for payment service providers
- Developer community discussions (GitHub, Stack Overflow, dev forums)
- Case studies from similar EdTech or SaaS platforms in Philippines
- Technical blogs and implementation tutorials

### Analysis Frameworks
- Integration complexity assessment (development effort, testing requirements)
- Compliance checklist for Philippine financial regulations
- Cost-benefit analysis of different integration approaches
- Risk matrix for security, compliance, and operational risks

### Data Requirements
- Current and accurate as of 2024/2025
- Official documentation from Xendit
- Verified compliance information from BSP
- Real implementation examples with code samples

## Expected Deliverables

### Executive Summary
- Recommended Xendit integration approach
- Key compliance requirements checklist
- Estimated implementation complexity and timeline
- Critical risks and mitigation strategies
- Business considerations (costs, settlement, limits)

### Detailed Analysis

**1. Integration Architecture**
- Recommended API/SDK approach
- Payment flow diagrams (checkout → payment → confirmation → webhook)
- Security implementation (API keys, signatures, encryption)
- Testing strategy (sandbox testing, UAT approach)

**2. Compliance & Regulatory**
- BSP requirements checklist
- PCI-DSS scope and responsibilities
- Data privacy considerations
- Required business documentation

**3. Supported Payment Methods**
- Credit/Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, JCB, etc.)
- E-wallets (GCash, PayMaya, GrabPay, etc.)
- Bank transfers and online banking
- Installment options (if applicable)
- Recommended payment methods for target users

**4. Implementation Guide**
- Step-by-step integration workflow
- Code examples for key operations (create payment, handle webhook, verify payment)
- Error handling patterns
- Testing checklist

**5. Business Operations**
- Transaction fee structure
- Settlement schedule and bank requirements
- Transaction limits and restrictions
- Customer support and dispute resolution process

### Supporting Materials
- Comparison matrix: Xendit vs alternatives (if relevant)
- Integration checklist/timeline
- Links to official documentation
- Sample code repositories or references

## Success Criteria

This research successfully:
- ✅ Provides clear technical implementation path for developers
- ✅ Identifies all compliance requirements for Philippine operations
- ✅ Estimates development effort and timeline
- ✅ Documents all business prerequisites and costs
- ✅ Enables architect to design integration architecture
- ✅ Enables PM to update Epic 2 with accurate requirements

## Timeline and Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - Blocking Epic 2 implementation. Research should be completed before architecture and story creation phases.

## Next Steps After Research

1. **Review Findings** - Validate research with your team
2. **Agent: Architect** - Design Xendit integration architecture based on findings
3. **Agent: PM** - Update Epic 2 with Xendit-specific requirements and stories
4. **Agent: PO** - Validate and shard updated documentation
5. **Agent: SM** - Create implementation stories
