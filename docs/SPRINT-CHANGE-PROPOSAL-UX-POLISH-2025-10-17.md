# Sprint Change Proposal: UX Polish Corrections

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Proposal ID:** SCP-2025-003  
**Prepared By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Change Type:** Corrective - Implementation Polish  
**Priority:** High (3 P0 Critical + 2 P1 High issues)

---

## Executive Summary

**Trigger:** Post-deployment UX audit by Sally (UX Expert) identified 5 visual/UX discrepancies between the deployed NCLEX 311 application and the approved mockup specification (`scratchpad/sample_chapter_demo_v23.html`).

**Nature of Change:** Implementation detail corrections - bring deployed features into alignment with approved design specifications. This is **not** a design change or pivot, but rather finishing touches to match the approved mockup.

**Impact:** Minimal - Frontend-only CSS/component adjustments totaling 5-6 hours of development effort.

**Recommendation:** Add 2 corrective stories to Epic 1.5, implement before starting Epic 2.

---

## 1. Issue Analysis Summary

### Triggering Event

**Source:** `docs/UX-IMPROVEMENT-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (prepared by Sally, UX Expert)

**Issues Identified:**

| # | Issue | Priority | Current State | Expected State | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Chapter card widths too narrow | üî¥ P0 | 248px | 350px min | Readability, cramped layouts |
| 2 | Concept content area constrained | üî¥ P0 | 800px max | 900px max | Content density, wasted space |
| 3 | Missing company logo in sidebar | üî¥ P0 | No logo | Ray Gapuz logo | Brand identity loss |
| 4 | Empty sidebar on /chapters page | üü° P1 | "Select a chapter..." | Progress statistics | Navigation context |
| 5 | Misleading Edit button on bookmarks | üü° P1 | 3 buttons | 2 buttons (View, Remove) | Interaction confusion |

**Root Cause:** Implementation details deviated from approved mockup during Epic 1.5 development. Specifications were correct; execution missed some details.

**Evidence:**
- Browser measurements via Chrome DevTools MCP
- Visual comparison screenshots
- Cross-referenced against `docs/front-end-spec.md`, `docs/ux-redesign-summary.md`, and approved mockup

---

## 2. Epic Impact Analysis

### Current Epic Status

**Epic 1.5: UX Enhancement**
- **Previous Status:** ‚úÖ Marked as Complete
- **Revised Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è In Correction (5-6 hours remaining)
- **Impact:** Epic completion was premature; corrective work needed

### Epic Modifications Required

**Add 2 Corrective Stories:**

1. **Story 1.5.12: Critical UX Polish - Card Widths & Brand Identity** (P0)
   - Fix chapter card widths (248px ‚Üí 350px)
   - Fix concept content width (800px ‚Üí 900px)
   - Add Ray Gapuz Review System logo to sidebar
   - **Effort:** 2.5 hours

2. **Story 1.5.13: UX Enhancement - Sidebar & Bookmark Polish** (P1)
   - Populate /chapters sidebar with progress statistics
   - Remove misleading Edit button from bookmark cards
   - **Effort:** 2.5-3.5 hours

**Total Additional Effort:** 5-6 hours (1-2 days for one developer)

### Future Epic Impact

**Epics 2 & 3:**
- ‚ùå **No impact** - These are isolated CSS/component corrections
- ‚úÖ **No dependencies affected**
- ‚úÖ **No API or data model changes**

**Epic Sequence:**
- Complete Epic 1.5 corrections (Stories 1.5.12-1.5.13)
- **Then** proceed to Epic 2 as planned
- Timeline impact: +1-2 sprint cycles

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

### Option Analysis

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Option 1 - Direct Adjustment / Integration**

**Rationale:**
- Lowest effort: 5-6 hours vs alternatives (10-12 hours rollback, weeks for re-scope)
- Lowest risk: CSS/component changes only, no architecture impact
- Preserves all completed Epic 1.5 work
- Fast execution: 1-2 sprints to complete
- Aligns implementation with approved specifications
- Team-friendly: additive work, not disruptive

**Alternative Options Rejected:**
- ‚ùå **Option 2 (Rollback):** 10-12 hours effort, higher risk, same end result - rejected as wasteful
- ‚ùå **Option 3 (MVP Re-scope):** Massive overkill for CSS fixes - not applicable

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: P0 Critical (Story 1.5.12) - Week 1**
1. Fix chapter card widths (30 min)
2. Fix concept content width (1 hour)
3. Add company logo to sidebar (1 hour)
4. QA validation (30 min)
5. **Deploy to production**

**Phase 2: P1 Enhancements (Story 1.5.13) - Week 2**
1. Create progress statistics component (2-2.5 hours)
2. Remove Edit button from bookmarks (30 min)
3. QA validation (30 min)
4. **Deploy to production**

**Total Timeline:** 1-2 sprint cycles

## 10. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| CSS changes break other pages | Low | Medium | Thorough visual regression testing across all pages |
| Logo URL inaccessible | Low | Low | Host logo locally as fallback |
| Progress statistics slow sidebar | Low | Low | Optimize data fetching, use existing cached data |
| Responsive issues on edge devices | Low | Low | Test at multiple breakpoints, use relative units |

### Rollback Plan

**If corrections cause issues:**
1. Git revert specific commits (CSS changes are isolated)
2. Redeploy previous version
3. Investigate issue offline
4. Re-implement with fixes

**Low Risk:** All changes are CSS/component updates with no database or API impact.

## 13. Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements

**What Went Well:**
- ‚úÖ Design system integration in Epic 1.5 was excellent
- ‚úÖ UX Expert (Sally) caught issues early via post-deployment audit
- ‚úÖ Clear specifications and mockup provided good reference

**What Could Improve:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add mockup comparison checkpoint** before marking epics complete

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dev checklist** should include "matches mockup" verification step

### Recommendations for Future Epics

1. **Add Mockup Validation Gate:** Before marking epic complete, UX Expert reviews against mockup
2. **Enhanced Visual QA:** Include mockup screenshot comparison in QA testing
3. **Dev Checklist Update:** Add "Visual comparison to mockup" as final dev task
4. **Pair Programming:** Consider UX Expert + Dev pairing for visual-heavy stories
