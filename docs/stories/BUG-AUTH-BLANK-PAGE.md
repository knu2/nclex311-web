# Bug Story: Authentication Blank Page After Redirect

## Status
**New** - Discovered during QA review of Story 1.5.9.1

## Priority
**HIGH** - Critical UX issue affecting production

## Issue Description

**As a** user navigating authenticated pages,  
**I encounter** a blank white page after authentication redirect,  
**which blocks me** from accessing content until I manually refresh (F5) the page.

### Observed Behavior

1. User clicks on any chapter link from `/chapters` page
2. Page navigates to `/login?callbackUrl=%2Fconcepts%2F[slug]`
3. User is already authenticated (session shows knu2@outlook.com)
4. Page renders completely blank - no content, no loading indicator
5. Manual page refresh (F5) loads the content correctly

### Expected Behavior

1. User clicks on chapter link
2. If authenticated, navigate directly to concept page
3. If not authenticated, redirect to login, then after login redirect to original destination
4. Content should render immediately without requiring manual refresh

## Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to https://nclex311-web-web.vercel.app/
2. Log in with valid credentials
3. Navigate to `/chapters` page (user menu â†’ Chapters)
4. Click on any available chapter button (e.g., "Navigate to Management of Care")
5. **Observe:** Page navigates but shows blank white screen
6. **Observe:** URL changes to `/login?callbackUrl=%2Fconcepts%2F[slug]`
7. Press F5 to refresh
8. **Observe:** Content loads correctly after refresh

## Environment

- **Production URL:** https://nclex311-web-web.vercel.app/
- **Browser:** Chrome (confirmed via chrome-devtools MCP)
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.x with App Router
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (session-based)
- **Discovered By:** Quinn (Test Architect) during Story 1.5.9.1 QA review
- **Discovery Date:** 2025-10-15

## Technical Analysis

### Evidence from QA Testing

- **No console errors:** Browser console shows no JavaScript errors
- **No server errors:** No 404s, 500s, or other HTTP errors logged
- **Session valid:** User authentication state is correct (knu2@outlook.com)
- **URL pattern:** Always redirects to `/login?callbackUrl=...` even for authenticated users
- **Recovery:** Manual refresh (F5) successfully loads content

### Suspected Root Causes

#### 1. Middleware Redirect Logic Issue
**File:** `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`

Possible issues:
- Middleware may be redirecting authenticated users unnecessarily
- CallbackUrl handling may not properly check authentication state
- Next.js 15 middleware behavior may have changed from previous versions

#### 2. Client/Server Hydration Mismatch
**Related to:** Story 1.5.8 React performance optimizations (but different root cause)

Possible issues:
- Server renders authenticated state, client renders unauthenticated state
- Next.js 15 client/server component boundaries not properly configured
- Session state not available during initial client-side render

#### 3. Authentication Session Handling
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth-utils.ts`

Possible issues:
- `getCurrentSession()` may not be properly awaited
- Session cookie not accessible during navigation
- Race condition between navigation and session verification

#### 4. Login Page Callback URL Processing
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx`

Possible issues:
- Callback URL redirect logic not executing for authenticated users
- Page renders blank before redirect completes
- Missing loading state or redirect logic

### Comparison to Story 1.5.8 Fix

Story 1.5.8 resolved similar blank page issues with:
- `React.memo()` wrapping components
- `useCallback()` for functions
- Proper `useEffect` dependency arrays

**However,** this current bug appears to be an **authentication/routing issue**, not a React rendering performance issue, because:
- Manual refresh works immediately
- No console errors (React warnings would appear)
- Issue specifically related to authenticated redirects
- Problem occurs during navigation, not component render

## Investigation Tasks

### Task 1: Analyze Middleware Redirect Logic
- [ ] Read `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`
- [ ] Check authentication state verification
- [ ] Verify redirect conditions for authenticated users
- [ ] Test with different authentication states (logged in, logged out, session expired)
- [ ] Review Next.js 15 middleware documentation for breaking changes

### Task 2: Inspect Session Handling
- [ ] Read `apps/web/src/lib/auth-utils.ts`
- [ ] Verify `getCurrentSession()` implementation
- [ ] Check if session is properly propagated during navigation
- [ ] Test session state persistence across redirects
- [ ] Review NextAuth.js session configuration

### Task 3: Review Login Page Logic
- [ ] Read `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- [ ] Check callback URL handling for authenticated users
- [ ] Verify redirect logic executes immediately
- [ ] Add loading state if redirect takes time
- [ ] Test with various callback URL formats

### Task 4: Check Client/Server Boundaries
- [ ] Identify 'use client' vs server component boundaries
- [ ] Verify session state is available in client components
- [ ] Check for hydration mismatches in DevTools
- [ ] Review Next.js 15 App Router authentication patterns

### Task 5: Add Debug Logging
- [ ] Add console.log to middleware to track authentication checks
- [ ] Add logging to login page redirect logic
- [ ] Add session state logging in problematic pages
- [ ] Track navigation flow from click to blank page to refresh

### Task 6: Implement Fix
- [ ] Based on investigation, implement appropriate fix
- [ ] Add loading states if redirect takes time
- [ ] Ensure authenticated users skip login page entirely
- [ ] Test fix across multiple scenarios

### Task 7: Verify Fix
- [ ] Test authenticated user navigation (should skip login)
- [ ] Test unauthenticated user redirect (should show login then redirect)
- [ ] Test session expiration scenarios
- [ ] Verify no blank pages in any navigation flow
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Deploy to production and verify

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Authenticated users clicking chapter links navigate directly to concepts without seeing login page
2. Unauthenticated users see login page, then after login are redirected to original destination
3. No blank pages appear during any authentication flow
4. Navigation completes smoothly without requiring manual refresh
5. Loading states are visible during any authentication checks or redirects
6. All existing authentication flows continue to work (login, logout, signup)
7. Middleware correctly differentiates between authenticated and unauthenticated states
8. Session state is properly available during client-side navigation

- **Story 1.5.9.1:** Refactor Bookmarks to Use Drizzle ORM (QA review where bug was discovered)
- **Story 1.5.8:** Progress Dashboard (similar React rendering optimizations, but different root cause)
- **Epic 1.x:** Authentication implementation (original auth setup)

## Files to Investigate

Primary suspects:
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware and redirect logic
- `apps/web/src/lib/auth-utils.ts` - Session handling utilities
- `apps/web/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page and callback URL processing
- `apps/web/src/app/concepts/[slug]/page.tsx` - Target page that renders blank

Secondary suspects:
- `apps/web/src/app/chapters/page.tsx` - Source page with chapter links
- `apps/web/src/components/Layout/MainLayout.tsx` - Layout authentication checks
- Next.js configuration files - App Router and middleware config

## Notes

- This bug exists independently of Story 1.5.9.1 (Bookmarks refactoring)
- Bug was discovered during production verification, not introduced by recent changes
- Likely existed since authentication implementation but may have worsened with Next.js 15 upgrade
- User workaround: Manual refresh (F5) after blank page appears
- Does not affect bookmarks functionality or any other Story 1.5.9.1 changes
