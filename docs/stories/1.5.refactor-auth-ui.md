# Story 1.4: Refactor Authentication UI

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the sign-up and login experience to match the established visual design and component library,
**so that** the application feels cohesive and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The Login and Registration forms are refactored to use components from the project's designated component library (e.g., MUI or Chakra UI).
2.  All colors, fonts, and spacing on the authentication pages must conform to the `Branding & Style Guide` in `docs/front-end-spec.md`.
3.  The layout of the forms must be fully responsive and adhere to the `Responsiveness Strategy` in `docs/front-end-spec.md`.
4.  All interactive elements must meet the `Accessibility Requirements` (WCAG 2.1 AA) defined in `docs/front-end-spec.md`, including focus indicators and keyboard navigation.
5.  Existing authentication functionality (login, logout, registration, error handling) remains unchanged and is verified by existing E2E tests.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Refactor UI Components** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Identify the components used for the login and registration forms (e.g., `LoginForm.tsx`, `RegistrationForm.tsx`).
    - [ ] Replace the existing raw HTML and Tailwind CSS elements with standardized components from the project's chosen UI library.
    - [ ] Create a shared `AuthLayout.tsx` component if one doesn't exist to ensure a consistent look and feel across all authentication-related pages.
- [ ] **Task 2: Apply Theme and Styling** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [ ] Apply the official color palette, typography, and spacing scale from the `front-end-spec.md` to the new components.
    - [ ] Ensure that buttons, input fields, labels, and error messages all match the styles defined in the design system.
    - [ ] Verify that the layout is fully responsive across all specified breakpoints (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
- [ ] **Task 3: Verify Functionality and Accessibility** (AC: 4, 5)
    - [ ] Run the full suite of existing Playwright E2E tests for authentication to confirm that no functional regressions have been introduced.
    - [ ] Manually test keyboard-only navigation for all interactive elements on the login and registration pages.
    - [ ] Use a screen reader (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA) to verify a logical content flow.
    - [ ] Run an automated accessibility checker (e.g., Axe) to catch any violations.

## Dev Notes

### Purpose of this Story
This is a **technical debt** story. The primary goal is to refactor the UI of the existing authentication pages to bring them into alignment with the official `docs/front-end-spec.md`. The underlying authentication logic, which was implemented in story `1.3` and `1.3.1`, should not be changed.

### Key Reference Documents
-   **Primary Source of Truth:** `docs/front-end-spec.md`. All UI decisions should be based on this document.
-   **Original Implementation:** The components to be refactored were created in story `1.3.user-authentication.md`.
