## 🎉 What Was Built Today

### 1. **Upgrade Page** (`/upgrade`) ✅
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/upgrade/page.tsx`

- Beautiful landing page with plan selection
- Premium features list with 6 key benefits
- Free vs Premium comparison cards
- Integrated `PlanSelector` and `CheckoutButton` components
- Trust indicators (secure payment, cancel anytime)
- Redirects premium users to chapters automatically

**Supporting Component**: `apps/web/src/components/payments/UpgradeContent.tsx`
- Client component managing plan selection state
- Handles checkout flow integration

### 2. **Chapter Grid Integration** ✅
**File**: `apps/web/src/components/Chapters/ChapterGrid.tsx` (Line 184)

- "Upgrade Now" button now navigates to `/upgrade` page
- Removed TODO placeholder
- Clean upgrade flow for users encountering locked content

### 3. **NextAuth Session Integration** ✅
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- JWT callback fetches subscription data from UserService
- Token includes: `subscriptionStatus`, `subscriptionPlan`, `subscriptionExpiresAt`, `autoRenew`
- Session callback adds subscription fields to session.user
- Automatic refresh on token updates

**Impact**: Premium status now available throughout the app via session

### 4. **Chapters Page Premium Status** ✅
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/chapters/page.tsx` (Line 32)

**Before**:
```typescript
is_premium: false, // TODO: Get from database in future story
```

**After**:
```typescript
is_premium: userSubscriptionStatus === 'premium',
```

**Impact**: `ChapterGrid` now correctly displays locked/unlocked chapters based on subscription

### 5. **Order Status API Endpoint** ✅
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/payments/[orderId]/status/route.ts`

**Features**:
- `GET /api/payments/[orderId]/status`
