# Story 1.5.1.1: Sidebar Layout Integration

## Status
**Ready for Review** (P0 - Critical)

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** the persistent sidebar to be visible on all authenticated pages,  
**so that** I can navigate between concepts and access quick actions without leaving my current page.

**Note:** This story completes Story 1.5.1 by integrating the existing ConceptList component into the main application layout.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ConceptList component is integrated into main layout (apps/web/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx)
2. Sidebar is visible on all authenticated pages:
   - `/chapters` - All Chapters listing
   - `/concepts/*` - Individual concept pages
   - `/dashboard/progress` - Progress dashboard
   - `/dashboard/bookmarks` - Bookmarks page
3. Sidebar behavior:
   - Desktop (â‰¥960px): Permanent drawer, always visible, 280px fixed width
   - Mobile (<960px): Temporary drawer, opened via hamburger menu, overlay background
4. Sidebar displays current chapter's concept list:
   - Shows concept number, title, and completion checkmarks
   - Highlights active/current concept
   - Scrollable concept list
5. Sidebar footer contains 3 quick-access buttons:
   - ðŸ“š All Chapters (navigates to `/chapters`)
   - ðŸ“Š Progress (navigates to `/dashboard/progress`)
   - ðŸ”– Bookmarks (navigates to `/dashboard/bookmarks`)
6. Mobile hamburger menu (â˜°) toggles sidebar drawer open/closed
7. Sidebar state persists during navigation (doesn't close on concept change on desktop)
8. Mobile: Sidebar auto-closes after selecting a concept
9. Responsive behavior tested at 768px, 960px, 1024px, 1920px viewports

**Note:** No premium upsell section in sidebar - top navigation "Upgrade to Premium" button is sufficient.

## Technical Notes

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` - Add sidebar to layout
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ConceptList.tsx` - Add footer section

**MUI Components:**
- Drawer (permanent/temporary variants)
- AppBar (mobile header)
- IconButton (hamburger menu)
- Box, Stack (layout)

**Routing:**
- Use Next.js `usePathname()` for current route
- Use `useRouter().push()` for navigation

**Design References:**

- Spec: `docs/front-end-spec.md` (Main Layout section)

**Sidebar Footer:**
- 3 navigation buttons only (All Chapters, Progress, Bookmarks)
