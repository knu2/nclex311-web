# Story 1.5.1.1: Sidebar Layout Integration

## Status
**Done** (P0 - Critical)

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** the persistent sidebar to be visible on all authenticated pages,  
**so that** I can navigate between concepts and access quick actions without leaving my current page.

**Note:** This story completes Story 1.5.1 by integrating the existing ConceptList component into the main application layout.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ConceptList component is integrated into main layout (apps/web/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx)
2. Sidebar is visible on all authenticated pages:
   - `/chapters` - All Chapters listing
   - `/concepts/*` - Individual concept pages
   - `/dashboard/progress` - Progress dashboard
   - `/dashboard/bookmarks` - Bookmarks page
3. Sidebar behavior:
   - Desktop (≥960px): Permanent drawer, always visible, 280px fixed width
   - Mobile (<960px): Temporary drawer, opened via hamburger menu, overlay background
4. Sidebar displays current chapter's concept list:
   - Shows concept number, title, and completion checkmarks
   - Highlights active/current concept
   - Scrollable concept list
5. Sidebar footer contains 3 quick-access buttons:
   - 📚 All Chapters (navigates to `/chapters`)
   - 📊 Progress (navigates to `/dashboard/progress`)
   - 🔖 Bookmarks (navigates to `/dashboard/bookmarks`)
6. Mobile hamburger menu (☰) toggles sidebar drawer open/closed
7. Sidebar state persists during navigation (doesn't close on concept change on desktop)
8. Mobile: Sidebar auto-closes after selecting a concept
9. Responsive behavior tested at 768px, 960px, 1024px, 1920px viewports

**Note:** No premium upsell section in sidebar - top navigation "Upgrade to Premium" button is sufficient.

## Technical Notes

**Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` - Add sidebar to layout
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ConceptList.tsx` - Add footer section

**MUI Components:**
- Drawer (permanent/temporary variants)
- AppBar (mobile header)
- IconButton (hamburger menu)
- Box, Stack (layout)

**Routing:**
- Use Next.js `usePathname()` for current route
- Use `useRouter().push()` for navigation

**Design References:**
- Mockup: `scratchpad/sample_chapter_demo_v23.html`
- Spec: `docs/front-end-spec.md` (Main Layout section)

**Sidebar Footer:**
- 3 navigation buttons only (All Chapters, Progress, Bookmarks)
- No premium upsell banner (top nav "Upgrade to Premium" button exists)

## Estimated Effort
**2-3 hours**

## Priority
**P0 - Critical** (Blocking core navigation UX)

## Dependencies
- Story 1.5.1 (ConceptList component already created)
- Story 1.5.2 (Main Layout Shell - may need revision)

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log References

**2025-10-16 - Sidebar Footer Redirect Issue Fix**

**Problem:** After QA added comprehensive tests, users reported that clicking sidebar footer navigation buttons (All Chapters, Progress, Bookmarks) was showing a redirect screen with "Redirecting..." message instead of navigating directly to the destination page.

**Root Cause:** Similar to BUG-AUTH-BLANK-PAGE, the SidebarFooter component was using Next.js `Link` components with `href` props. This triggered Next.js 15's prefetch/RSC (React Server Component) request handling, which conflicted with the middleware authentication flow, causing unnecessary redirects through the `/login` page even for authenticated users.

**Solution:**
1. **Changed navigation method**: Replaced `component={Link} href="..."` with `onClick={() => router.push(...)}`
2. **Removed Link import**: No longer needed since all navigation uses `useRouter().push()`
3. **Preserved onClose behavior**: Mobile drawer still closes properly before navigation
4. **Updated all 15 footer tests**: Changed from `getByRole('link')` to `getByRole('button')` and verified `router.push()` calls

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ConceptList.tsx` (lines 66-161) - Changed to router.push() navigation
- `apps/web/__tests__/components/Sidebar/ConceptList.test.tsx` (footer test sections) - Updated tests
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` (lines 32-60) - Enhanced RSC request detection
- `apps/web/src/lib/auth-utils.ts` (lines 60-73) - **Critical: Added NextAuth v5 cookie configuration**

**Test Results:** 
- All 15 Sidebar Footer Tests passing (15/15) ✅
- Local dev testing: ✅ PASS
- Production testing: ✅ PASS

**The Complete Fix (3 parts):**
1. **Sidebar Component**: Changed from Link to router.push() to avoid prefetch issues
2. **Middleware Enhancement**: Better RSC request detection with additional headers
3. **Auth Config (CRITICAL)**: Added cookie name configuration to NextAuth auth() function - this was the missing piece causing infinite redirect loops. The middleware had the cookie name fix, but the server-side auth() function didn't, causing `getCurrentSession()` to fail while middleware succeeded.

**Reference:** This fix completes the NextAuth v5 migration started in BUG-AUTH-BLANK-PAGE (docs/stories/BUG-AUTH-BLANK-PAGE.md).

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ConceptList.tsx` - Added SidebarFooter component with navigation buttons
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/progress/page.tsx` - Wrapped with MainLayout for sidebar visibility
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/bookmarks/page.tsx` - Wrapped with MainLayout for sidebar visibility

**New Files:**

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Existing Tests (22 total):**
- ✅ Rendering tests (6)
- ✅ Navigation tests (4)
- ✅ Responsive behavior (3)
- ✅ Accessibility (4)
- ✅ Progress calculation (2)
- ✅ API integration (3)

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- ❌ **Sidebar footer navigation** (AC#5) - Zero test coverage for 3 critical navigation buttons
- ⚠️ Footer mobile auto-close behavior not tested
- ⚠️ Footer-only view (no chapterId) not tested
- ⚠️ Specific viewport breakpoints (768px, 1024px, 1920px) not explicitly tested

### Security Review

**Status:** ✅ PASS

- Server-side authentication checks on all dashboard pages
- No XSS vulnerabilities (MUI components, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Proper session validation before rendering
- Authentication redirects with callback URLs implemented correctly

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** ✅ PASS

- React.memo prevents unnecessary ConceptList re-renders
- useCallback memoizes fetchChapterData to prevent recreations
- Efficient drawer state management with localStorage
- No performance bottlenecks identified
- Proper loading states prevent layout shift

### Reliability Assessment

**Status:** ⚠️ CONCERNS

**Issues:**
1. API error handling is basic - no retry logic for transient failures
2. Network errors result in permanent error state requiring page reload
3. No fallback UI or "Retry" button for failed API calls

**Recommendation:** Add exponential backoff retry or user-triggered retry button

### Improvements Checklist

**Immediate (Before Production):**
- [ ] **P0:** Add comprehensive unit tests for SidebarFooter component (2-3 hours)
  - Test: Renders 3 navigation buttons with correct labels
  - Test: Navigates to /chapters, /dashboard/progress, /dashboard/bookmarks
  - Test: Mobile auto-close after footer navigation
  - Test: Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Test: Footer-only view when no chapterId
- [ ] **P1:** Add explicit viewport breakpoint tests for 768px, 1024px, 1920px (1 hour)

**Future Improvements:**
- [ ] **P2:** Add retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **P3:** Add localStorage quota exceeded error handling (1 hour)
- [ ] **P3:** Consider E2E tests for complete navigation flows (3-4 hours)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Matrix:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Untested footer breaks navigation | 5 | 7 | 35 | **Medium** |
| Missing viewport tests miss responsive issues | 4 | 5 | 20 | Low |
| API failures cause permanent errors | 3 | 5 | 15 | Low |
| localStorage quota exceeded | 2 | 3 | 6 | Low |

**Highest Risk (Score 35):** Sidebar footer navigation has zero test coverage despite being critical infrastructure used across all authenticated pages. Future refactoring could break these paths without detection.
