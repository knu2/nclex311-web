# Story 1.0: Repository Setup & Project Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the Git repository, set up the Next.js monorepo structure, and establish baseline project documentation,
**so that** I have a clean, organized foundation for all subsequent development work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore for Next.js projects.
2. Next.js application is scaffolded with TypeScript configuration.
3. Monorepo workspace structure is established (apps/, packages/ directories as specified in architecture).
4. Baseline README.md is created with project overview and initial setup instructions.
5. Coding standards documentation is referenced and accessible to developers.
6. Initial package.json workspace configuration is properly set up.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundational story - no previous stories exist.

### Monorepo Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]
- **Structure:** Monorepo using npm Workspaces
- **Package Organization:** 
  - `apps/` directory for the main web application
  - `packages/` directory for shared code (types, UI components)
- **Monorepo Tool:** npm Workspaces (simple and effective for this scale)

### Next.js Application Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework:** Next.js ~14.x 
- **Language:** TypeScript ~5.x for type safety and developer experience
- **Purpose:** Full-stack React framework as specified in PRD
- **Architecture:** Integrated frontend/backend in same codebase

### Git Repository Requirements
Based on standard Next.js practices:
- **Ignore Files:** node_modules/, .next/, .env.local, .vercel/, dist/, build/
- **Include:** .env.example (but never .env with secrets)
- **Structure:** Support for monorepo with multiple packages

### File Locations
Expected directory structure after completion:
```
/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                 # Main Next.js application
│       ├── pages/ or app/   # Next.js routing (depending on version)
│       ├── public/          # Static assets
│       ├── package.json     # App-specific dependencies
│       └── ...
├── packages/                # Shared packages
│   ├── types/              # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── ui/                 # Shared UI components (future)
│   └── ...
├── docs/                   # Project documentation (already exists)
├── package.json            # Root workspace configuration
├── README.md               # Project overview and setup
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
└── ...
```

### Package.json Workspace Configuration
Root package.json should include:
```json
{
  "name": "nclex311-web",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run dev --workspace=apps/web",
    "build": "npm run build --workspace=apps/web",
    "start": "npm run start --workspace=apps/web"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Version:** TypeScript ~5.x
- **Purpose:** Type safety and developer experience across the stack
- **Configuration:** Proper tsconfig.json for Next.js with strict settings
- **Workspace Support:** Configure TypeScript to work across monorepo packages

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Alignment:** Must support Vercel deployment (Next.js optimized)
- **Development Experience:** Should enable rapid development as required by 4-month timeline
- **Scalability:** Structure should support future packages and applications
- **Integration:** Must work seamlessly with future CI/CD setup in Story 1.1

### Testing
**Test Requirements for This Story:**
- Verify `npm install` works from root
- Verify `npm run dev` starts the development server successfully
- Verify Next.js application loads in browser (basic "Hello World" page)
- Verify TypeScript compilation works without errors
- Verify workspace configuration allows importing between packages (basic test)

**Testing Standards:**
- All package installations should complete without errors
- Development server should start on expected port (typically 3000)
- Basic Next.js routing should work (home page accessible)
- TypeScript should provide proper type checking

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Create a simple test page to verify Next.js routing works
- Test workspace dependency resolution with a basic shared type
- Verify .gitignore properly excludes build artifacts and secrets
- Confirm README.md instructions allow new developer to get started

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The repository foundation is well-structured and aligns with the monorepo and tech stack requirements. TypeScript strict mode is enabled, workspace resolution works (validated via shared types usage in the web app), and the build pipeline produces a clean production build. One configuration issue was identified related to Next.js workspace root inference, which has been corrected.

### Refactoring Performed

- File: apps/web/next.config.ts
  - Change: Added `outputFileTracingRoot` pointing to the monorepo root and imported `path`
  - Why: Next.js inferred the wrong workspace root due to multiple lockfiles, emitting a warning during build
  - How: Ensures correct file tracing and removes misleading warning during builds

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Coding standards document not found at `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`; add or update reference
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches expected monorepo layout (apps/, packages/), workspace config present
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No automated tests present; tech stack prescribes Jest/RTL and Playwright
- All ACs Met: Partial (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC6 validated; AC4/AC5 have documentation gaps as noted)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fix Next.js workspace root inference warning (apps/web/next.config.ts)
- [ ] Add Coding Standards document (proposed: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`) and reference from README
- [ ] Initialize testing stack (Jest + React Testing Library) in apps/web
- [ ] Add basic unit test for the Home page rendering and shared types usage
- [ ] Add CI step to run type-check, lint, and tests
- [ ] Validate README developer setup steps end-to-end (optionally via a smoke script)

### Security Review

No sensitive files committed; .env patterns are ignored. Scope is foundational; no auth or data handling code present. No issues identified.

### Performance Considerations

Baseline app only; build output is small and optimized. No immediate perf concerns. Future tasks: add lint rules/perf budgets once features emerge.

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/web/next.config.ts (configuration fix). Please update the Story File List if needed.
