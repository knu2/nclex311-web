# Story 1.0: Repository Setup & Project Scaffolding

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the Git repository, set up the Next.js monorepo structure, and establish baseline project documentation,
**so that** I have a clean, organized foundation for all subsequent development work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore for Next.js projects.
2. Next.js application is scaffolded with TypeScript configuration.
3. Monorepo workspace structure is established (apps/, packages/ directories as specified in architecture).
4. Baseline README.md is created with project overview and initial setup instructions.
5. Coding standards documentation is referenced and accessible to developers.
6. Initial package.json workspace configuration is properly set up.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Verify application runs locally with npm run dev
- [ ] Monorepo Structure Setup (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create apps/ directory for the main web application

  - [ ] Move Next.js app to apps/web/ directory
  - [ ] Set up proper directory structure as per architecture
- [ ] Workspace Configuration (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Configure root package.json with npm workspaces
  - [ ] Set up workspace dependencies and scripts
  - [ ] Ensure proper package resolution across workspace
  - [ ] Test workspace configuration works correctly
- [ ] Project Documentation (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create baseline README.md with project overview
  - [ ] Add initial setup instructions for developers
  - [ ] Reference coding standards documentation location
  - [ ] Include basic project structure explanation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundational story - no previous stories exist.

### Monorepo Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]
- **Structure:** Monorepo using npm Workspaces
- **Package Organization:** 
  - `apps/` directory for the main web application
  - `packages/` directory for shared code (types, UI components)
- **Monorepo Tool:** npm Workspaces (simple and effective for this scale)

### Next.js Application Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework:** Next.js ~14.x 
- **Language:** TypeScript ~5.x for type safety and developer experience
- **Purpose:** Full-stack React framework as specified in PRD
- **Architecture:** Integrated frontend/backend in same codebase

### Git Repository Requirements
Based on standard Next.js practices:
- **Ignore Files:** node_modules/, .next/, .env.local, .vercel/, dist/, build/
- **Include:** .env.example (but never .env with secrets)
- **Structure:** Support for monorepo with multiple packages

### File Locations
Expected directory structure after completion:
```
/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                 # Main Next.js application
│       ├── pages/ or app/   # Next.js routing (depending on version)
│       ├── public/          # Static assets
│       ├── package.json     # App-specific dependencies
│       └── ...
├── packages/                # Shared packages
│   ├── types/              # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── ui/                 # Shared UI components (future)
│   └── ...
├── docs/                   # Project documentation (already exists)
├── package.json            # Root workspace configuration
├── README.md               # Project overview and setup
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
└── ...
```

### Package.json Workspace Configuration
Root package.json should include:
```json
{
  "name": "nclex311-web",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run dev --workspace=apps/web",
    "build": "npm run build --workspace=apps/web",
    "start": "npm run start --workspace=apps/web"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Version:** TypeScript ~5.x
- **Purpose:** Type safety and developer experience across the stack
- **Configuration:** Proper tsconfig.json for Next.js with strict settings
- **Workspace Support:** Configure TypeScript to work across monorepo packages

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Alignment:** Must support Vercel deployment (Next.js optimized)
- **Development Experience:** Should enable rapid development as required by 4-month timeline
- **Scalability:** Structure should support future packages and applications
- **Integration:** Must work seamlessly with future CI/CD setup in Story 1.1

### Testing
**Test Requirements for This Story:**
- Verify `npm install` works from root
- Verify `npm run dev` starts the development server successfully
- Verify Next.js application loads in browser (basic "Hello World" page)
- Verify TypeScript compilation works without errors
- Verify workspace configuration allows importing between packages (basic test)

**Testing Standards:**
- All package installations should complete without errors
- Development server should start on expected port (typically 3000)
- Basic Next.js routing should work (home page accessible)
- TypeScript should provide proper type checking

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Create a simple test page to verify Next.js routing works
- Test workspace dependency resolution with a basic shared type
- Verify .gitignore properly excludes build artifacts and secrets
- Confirm README.md instructions allow new developer to get started
