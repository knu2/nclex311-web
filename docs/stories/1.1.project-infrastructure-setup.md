# Story 1.1: Project & Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up database connectivity, configure CI/CD pipeline, install testing frameworks, and establish deployment automation,
**so that** I have a stable and automated foundation for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PostgreSQL database connection is established and configured with environment variables.
2. Basic CI/CD pipeline is configured using Vercel deployment + GitHub Actions for testing/linting.
3. Testing frameworks are installed and configured (Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E).
4. A basic health-check API route is implemented and accessible.
5. Environment variable management is set up (.env.example, .env.local template).
6. Pushing to the `main` branch automatically triggers deployment to staging environment.
7. Database schema baseline is created and migration strategy is established.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.0: Successfully established Next.js 15.x monorepo with TypeScript 5.x, npm workspaces, and basic project structure. The foundation is solid for adding infrastructure components.

### Database Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.x as specified in tech stack
- **Schema:** Complete schema defined with ENUM types (subscription_tier, question_type, payment_status)
- **Tables:** users, chapters, concepts, questions, options, bookmarks, completed_concepts, comments, payments
- **Connection:** Use environment variables for DATABASE_URL
- **Migration Strategy:** SQL scripts for schema creation and updates

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database Technology:** PostgreSQL 16.x for primary data storage
- **Connection Method:** Environment variable-based configuration
- **Platform:** Vercel Postgres recommended for seamless integration

### Testing Framework Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library (latest) - Industry standard for testing React applications
- **Backend Testing:** Jest + Supertest (latest) - Jest for test runner, Supertest for HTTP requests to API endpoints
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright (latest) - Modern, powerful tool for reliable cross-browser testing

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Testing & CI/CD Alignment]
- **Testing Strategy:** Test-first, automation-friendly setup
- **Unit/Component Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
- **API Route Tests:** Jest + Supertest for backend API routes  
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright for cross-browser user flows

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Build/Deploy:** Vercel CLI / Git (latest) - Git-based workflow with automated CI/CD
- **CI/CD System:** Vercel + GitHub Actions - Vercel for deployments, GitHub Actions for testing/linting

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Testing & CI/CD Alignment]
- **Deployment Strategy:** Vercel for preview on PRs, staging on main branch
- **GitHub Actions:** Run lint, unit/API tests, and basic E2E smoke tests on PRs and main
- **Environment Strategy:** Use .env.local for local dev, .env.example committed to repo

### API Route Structure
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes (~14.x) - Serverless backend logic
- **API Style:** REST - Standard approach that fits naturally with Next.js API Routes

### File Locations
Based on Next.js monorepo structure established in Story 1.0:
```
/
├── apps/web/
│   ├── src/pages/api/        # API routes (if using pages router)
│   ├── src/app/api/          # API routes (if using app router)
│   ├── __tests__/            # Jest unit/integration tests

│   └── ...
├── .github/workflows/        # GitHub Actions CI/CD
├── .env.example              # Environment variable template
└── ...
```

### Environment Variables Required
Essential variables for this story:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret (for future auth setup)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application URL for auth callbacks
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment indicator (development/production)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Platform:** Vercel deployment required for serverless functions
- **Integration:** Must work with existing Next.js 15.x and TypeScript 5.x setup
- **Scalability:** Support up to 1,000 concurrent users through serverless architecture
- **Development Speed:** Maintain rapid development capability for 4-month timeline

### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/__tests__/` directory
- E2E tests: `apps/web/e2e/` directory
- API tests: `apps/web/__tests__/api/` subdirectory

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** Jest + React Testing Library focusing on user-facing behavior
- **Backend:** Jest + Supertest for API route integration testing
- **E2E:** Playwright for reliable cross-browser testing

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Health check API endpoint must have unit tests
- Database connectivity should be testable in isolation
- CI/CD pipeline should run all test suites
- Sample tests should demonstrate proper patterns for future development
