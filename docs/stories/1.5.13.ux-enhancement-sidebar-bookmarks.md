# Story 1.5.13: UX Enhancement - Sidebar & Bookmark Polish

**Epic:** 1.5 - UX Enhancement  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** Done  
**Type:** Enhancement / Polish  
**Estimated Effort:** 2.5-3.5 hours

---

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** helpful progress statistics in the sidebar when browsing chapters and clearer bookmark actions,  
**so that** I have better context for my learning journey and can interact with bookmarks without confusion.

---

## Context

**Trigger:** UX audit (Sally) identified 2 high-priority UX enhancements:
1. Empty sidebar on `/chapters` page provides no value (wasted space)
2. Misleading Edit button on bookmark cards creates confusion

**Impact:** Reduced navigation context, missed engagement opportunity, interaction friction.

**Reference Documents:**
- `docs/UX-IMPROVEMENT-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (Issues #4, #5)
- `scratchpad/sample_chapter_demo_v23.html` (mockup reference)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Populate /chapters Sidebar with Progress Statistics (Issue #4)**
   - Sidebar on `/chapters` page displays overview statistics instead of empty space
   - Statistics section includes:
     - Heading: "📚 Your Progress"
     - Concepts completed count (e.g., "🟢 5 Concepts Completed")
     - Free concepts available (e.g., "📖 144 Free Concepts Available")
     - Premium concepts locked (e.g., "🔒 179 Premium Locked")
     - Bookmarks count (e.g., "🔖 6 Bookmarks")
   - Statistics are fetched from user progress data (API or existing state)
   - Statistics update dynamically as user progresses
   - Section is visually distinct with proper spacing and typography
   - Sidebar still includes quick action buttons (All Chapters, Progress, Bookmarks)
   - Matches design intent from recommendations document

2. **Remove Misleading Edit Button from Bookmarks (Issue #5)**
   - Bookmark cards show only 2 action buttons instead of 3
   - Buttons displayed:
     - "View" or "View Concept" (eye icon) - navigates to concept page
     - "Remove" (trash icon) - removes bookmark
   - "Edit Note" button is completely removed
   - Buttons are clearly labeled with icons and text
   - Button spacing and alignment remain clean
   - User can still edit notes by navigating to concept page and using "Take Notes" feature

3. **Visual Validation**
   - Sidebar on `/chapters` page feels valuable and informative
   - Bookmark cards feel cleaner with 2-button layout
   - No layout regressions on other pages
   - Interactions are intuitive and clear

## Dev Notes

### Affected Components

1. **Sidebar / Chapters Page:**
   - File: `apps/web/src/app/(authenticated)/chapters/page.tsx` or sidebar routing logic
   - New component: `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ProgressStatistics.tsx` (create new)
   - Add conditional rendering: Show progress stats when route is `/chapters`

2. **Bookmark Card:**
   - File: `apps/web/src/components/Bookmark/BookmarkCard.tsx` (or similar)
   - Remove Edit button from button group
   - Keep only View and Remove buttons

### Data Requirements for Progress Statistics

**User Progress Data Needed:**
- Completed concepts count (user-specific)
- Bookmarks count (user-specific)
- Free concepts total (static: 144 from chapters 1-4)
- Premium concepts total (static: 179 from chapters 5-8)

**Potential Data Sources:**
1. Existing API endpoint (e.g., `/api/user/progress`)
2. Existing React context (UserProgressContext or similar)
3. Aggregated from existing data (concept completion tracking from Story 1.5.8)

**Developer Decision:** Use most efficient data source. If no aggregated endpoint exists, calculate from existing completion/bookmark data.

### Design System References

**Progress Statistics Component:**
- Section heading: `text-sm font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-3`
- Stat items:
  - Icon: Emoji or MUI icon (16px)
  - Count: `text-2xl font-bold text-primary`
  - Label: `text-xs text-gray-500`
- Spacing: `space-y-3` between items
- Background: Optional light gray (`bg-gray-50`) with rounded corners

**Bookmark Card Buttons:**
- Button size: `min-h-[44px]` (touch-friendly)
- View button: Primary blue (`bg-primary text-white`)
- Remove button: Outline red (`border-red-500 text-red-500`)
- Gap between buttons: `gap-2` (0.5rem)

### Testing Standards
- **Test Files:** Consider adding unit tests for `ProgressStatistics` component
  - Test rendering with different data values
  - Test data fetching logic (if applicable)
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Visual comparison to recommendations document
  - Test with multiple user accounts at different progress levels
  - Responsive testing at 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1440px viewports
  - Cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Verify progress statistics update when user completes concept
  - Verify bookmark count updates when user adds/removes bookmark

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- gpt-5 (medium reasoning)
- Story Implementation Date: 2025-10-17

### Debug Log References
No critical issues encountered during implementation.

### Completion Notes List
1. **Progress Statistics Component**: Created new `ProgressStatistics.tsx` component that fetches and displays user progress data including completed concepts, bookmarks, free concepts (chapters 1-4), and premium concepts (chapters 5-8)
2. **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/users/[id]/progress` endpoint that reuses existing `ProgressService` and `BookmarksService` from Stories 1.5.8 and 1.5.9
3. **Free/Premium Calculation**: Implemented based on chapter number (chapters 1-4 = free, chapters 5-8 = premium) using database joins rather than an `isPremium` field
4. **Sidebar Integration**: Modified `ConceptList.tsx` to accept `userId` prop and conditionally render `ProgressStatistics` when on `/chapters` route (no chapterId provided)
5. **Bookmark Card Simplification**: Removed Edit button and associated handler, keeping only View and Remove buttons for clearer UX
6. **BookmarksView Updates**: Removed `NotesModal` integration and `onEditNote` handler - users can edit notes by navigating to concept page directly
7. **Type Safety**: All components properly typed with TypeScript interfaces, no type errors in implementation
8. **ESLint Compliance**: All modified files pass ESLint checks with zero warnings

### File List
**Created:**
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar/ProgressStatistics.tsx` - New progress statistics component

3. Visual regression tests for bookmark card 2-button layout
4. Test statistics update after concept completion event

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW ⚠️

**Identified Risks:**
- **Medium Risk:** No automated UI tests for new components
  - **Mitigation:** Manual testing completed, visual regressions unlikely
  - **Monitor:** User feedback on statistics accuracy

**No Critical or High Risks Identified**

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Usability:** ✓ EXCELLENT
- Progress statistics provide valuable context
- Bookmark card simplification reduces cognitive load
- Clear visual hierarchy and spacing
