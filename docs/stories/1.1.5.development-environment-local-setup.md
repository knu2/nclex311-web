## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (Done): Successfully established infrastructure foundation with Supabase database, testing frameworks (Jest + Playwright), CI/CD pipeline, and health check endpoint. Environment variables template exists. Migration system operational. All core infrastructure ready for developer onboarding.

### Database Configuration
- **Database Provider**: PostgreSQL 16.x via Supabase managed service [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database]
- **Client Library**: Supabase JS Client v2.57.x with built-in connection pooling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database Client]
- **Environment Variables**: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Environment Configuration]
- **Migration Strategy**: Hybrid approach using Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor with validation scripts [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Migration Management System]
- **Local Development**: Manual migration via `npm run migrate` for validation [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Migration Management System]

### Development Workflow Requirements
- **Local Development Setup**: Install dependencies, configure environment, start dev server [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Local Development Setup]
- **Dependency Management**: npm workspaces for monorepo structure [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Root Workspace Configuration]
- **Database Management**: Supabase Dashboard for schema, validation scripts for verification [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Database Management]

- **Seeding Scripts**: apps/web/scripts/ directory for database utilities [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Main Web Application]

### Testing Framework Setup
- **Unit Testing**: Jest 30.x + React Testing Library 16.x [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Testing]
- **Integration Testing**: Jest + Supertest 7.x [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Backend Testing]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.55.x with cross-browser support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#E2E Testing]
- **Test Commands**: Configured in package.json scripts [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Application Scripts]

### Code Quality Tools
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration required [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Main Web Application]
