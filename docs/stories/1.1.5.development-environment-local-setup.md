## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (Done): Successfully established infrastructure foundation with Supabase database, testing frameworks (Jest + Playwright), CI/CD pipeline, and health check endpoint. Environment variables template exists. Migration system operational. All core infrastructure ready for developer onboarding.

### Database Configuration

- **Client Library**: Supabase JS Client v2.57.x with built-in connection pooling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Database Client]
- **Environment Variables**: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Environment Configuration]
- **Migration Strategy**: Hybrid approach using Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor with validation scripts [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Migration Management System]
- **Local Development**: Manual migration via `npm run migrate` for validation [Source: architecture/infrastructure-components.md#Migration Management System]

### Development Workflow Requirements
- **Local Development Setup**: Install dependencies, configure environment, start dev server [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Local Development Setup]
- **Dependency Management**: npm workspaces for monorepo structure [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Root Workspace Configuration]
