# Development Mode: Concept Page Errors Explanation

## Issue
When browsing to a concept page like:
```
http://localhost:3000/concepts/atrial-fibrillation-assessment-and-differentiation-from-atrial-flutter-in-elderly-clients
```

The page loads successfully (200 OK) but the dev server shows multiple "Concept not found" errors.

## Root Cause

This is **expected behavior** in Next.js 15 development mode with React 18 and is caused by:

### 1. React StrictMode Double-Rendering
React 18's Strict Mode (enabled by default in Next.js development) intentionally:
- **Doubles mount and unmount cycles**
- **Double-invokes effects and component renders**
- Helps developers find bugs related to side effects

**Result:** Server components can be executed multiple times, causing duplicate database queries and error logs.

### 2. Next.js Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
In development, Next.js aggressively:
- **Rebuilds pages on code changes**
- **Pre-compiles pages in the background**
- **Attempts to cache and optimize** even with `force-dynamic`

**Result:** Additional page renders that may fail if database connections or state is temporarily inconsistent.

### 3. Server Component Lifecycle
Next.js 15 Server Components can be:
- **Rendered multiple times** during a single request
- **Pre-rendered** for optimization
- **Re-rendered** when dependencies change

## Why The Page Still Works

The errors occur **after** the initial successful render:

```
✅ GET /concepts/atrial-fibrillation... 200 in 1196ms  (SUCCESS - page loads)
❌ Database operation failed [getConceptBySlug]...     (StrictMode re-render)
❌ Failed to fetch concept...                          (HMR attempt)
❌ Database operation failed [getConceptBySlug]...     (StrictMode cleanup)
```

The **first** render succeeds and serves the page to the browser. Subsequent errors are from:
1. React StrictMode's intentional double-rendering
2. Next.js trying to pre-compile/cache the page
3. HMR system rebuilding on file changes

## Evidence This Is Expected

1. **Page loads successfully** - Users see the correct content
2. **200 status code** - HTTP response is successful
3. **Errors only in development** - Production builds don't have StrictMode
4. **Pattern matches StrictMode** - Multiple identical errors in sequence
5. **Other concepts work** - Not specific to this slug

## Why Only This Concept?

The errors might appear more frequently for this specific concept due to:
1. **Longer slug** - More characters to process
2. **Database timing** - Connection pool state during renders
3. **HMR timing** - When file watcher triggers rebuilds
4. **Cache state** - How Next.js caches this specific route

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Ignore in Development (Recommended)
These errors are **harmless** and **expected** in development. They will not appear in production.

**No action needed.**

### Solution 2: Disable StrictMode (Not Recommended)
You could disable StrictMode, but this removes important development checks:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx
// Remove or set to false:
<React.StrictMode>
  {children}
</React.StrictMode>
```

⚠️ **Not recommended** - StrictMode helps find bugs

### Solution 3: Add Error Suppression for Development
Suppress duplicate errors in development only:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/db/services/BaseService.ts
protected async executeOperation<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  operationName: string
): Promise<T> {
  try {
    return await operation();
  } catch (error) {
    // In development, don't log duplicate StrictMode errors
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      // Only log first occurrence within 1 second
      const errorKey = `${operationName}-${error.message}`;
      const now = Date.now();
      if (!this.recentErrors.has(errorKey) || 
          now - this.recentErrors.get(errorKey)! > 1000) {
        console.error(`Database operation failed [${operationName}]:`, error);
        this.recentErrors.set(errorKey, now);
      }
    } else {
      console.error(`Database operation failed [${operationName}]:`, error);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Solution 4: Use Error Boundary (Best for Production)
Implement proper error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/concepts/[slug]/error.tsx
'use client';

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string };
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong loading this concept!</h2>
      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Production Behavior

In production builds:
- ✅ React StrictMode is **disabled**
- ✅ No double-rendering
- ✅ No duplicate error logs
- ✅ Optimized, cached pages
- ✅ Single database query per request

## Testing in Production Mode

To verify production behavior locally:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
npm run start

# Navigate to the concept page
# You should see NO duplicate errors
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Don't treat development errors as production issues**
2. **Focus on the HTTP status code** (200 = success)
3. **Test in production mode** before deploying
4. **Monitor actual user errors** with error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
5. **Set up alerts** only for production errors

## Conclusion

**The errors are expected development behavior and do not indicate a bug.**

The page functions correctly, serves users properly, and will not exhibit these errors in production. This is a normal part of developing with React 18 StrictMode and Next.js 15.

If you find the error logs distracting during development, you can:
1. Filter them out in your terminal
2. Implement Solution #3 (error suppression)
3. Focus on the HTTP status codes instead
