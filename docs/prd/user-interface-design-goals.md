# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is to create a modern, mobile-first, and highly intuitive web application that transforms the static NCLEX 311 content into a dynamic and engaging learning experience. The platform should feel encouraging and supportive, empowering users to study effectively anytime, anywhere.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Interactive Quizzing:** A simple, clear interface for answering multiple-choice questions with immediate visual feedback (correct/incorrect) and one-click access to detailed rationales.
*   **Concept Navigation:** Easy browsing and searching of all 323 concepts, with clear indicators for free vs. premium content.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Content and options are revealed contextually to avoid overwhelming the user. For example, rationales are shown only after a question is answered.
*   **One-Click Bookmarking:** A simple, persistent toggle to save or unsave a concept for later review from the dashboard.

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Login/Sign-Up Screen:** A clean and simple form for user authentication.
*   **Main Dashboard:** A central hub that lists all NCLEX categories and concepts, and provides access to the user's bookmarked items and completed concepts.
*   **Concept/Quiz Viewer:** The primary interface where users read concept text and take the associated quiz.
*   **Subscription/Upgrade Page:** A clear and secure page for users to upgrade to the premium plan, integrated with Maya Business.
*   **User Profile/Settings Page:** A basic page for managing account details.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

To ensure the application is usable by the widest possible audience, we will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. This was assumed as a best practice for a modern educational platform.

## Branding

The application should incorporate the branding of the established Ray A. Gapuz review system to leverage its authority and trust. Specific brand guidelines (logos, color palette, typography) need to be provided.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a fully responsive web app, ensuring a seamless and optimized experience across all modern desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
