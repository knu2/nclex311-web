## Background Context

The current NCLEX 311 content exists as a static printed book, which lacks interactivity, accessibility, and personalization. This project aims to transform the "NCLEX 311 QuickFixÂ® Edition" book into a modern, mobile-first, interactive web application. The platform will solve the limitations of the print format by offering a dynamic and engaging learning tool for nursing students and professionals preparing for the NCLEX-RN exam, primarily targeting aspiring nurses in the Philippines and overseas.

The platform will be built on a freemium model, providing free access to a portion of the content to showcase its value and offering full access via an annual subscription. This will create a more efficient, engaging, and supportive study process, ultimately boosting user confidence and preparedness for the NCLEX-RN examination.
