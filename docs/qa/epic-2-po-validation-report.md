## CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES

### üî¥ BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix Before Development)

#### 1. Business Configuration Undefined
**Location:** Epic 2 Story 2.1 Acceptance Criteria #10, #8  
**Issue:** Subscription model and pricing marked as [TBD]
- Cannot implement invoice creation without amount
- Cannot configure subscription expiration logic
- Blocks Week 1 implementation

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Business stakeholder decision on subscription model (annual/quarterly/monthly)
- [ ] Set pricing in PHP (e.g., ‚Ç±1,999 annual)
- [ ] Update Epic 2 PRD with final decision
- [ ] PO validates pricing aligns with market research

**Owner:** Product Manager (John)  
**Timeline:** IMMEDIATE (blocks all work)

---

#### 2. Xendit Business Verification Timeline
**Location:** Section 3 - External Dependencies  
**Issue:** Xendit production account requires 2-4 weeks verification
- Week 4 production launch at risk
- Cannot test with real transactions until approved

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] START Xendit account creation NOW (before story creation)
- [ ] Prepare business documents:
  - SEC Certificate of Registration
  - Mayor's Permit / Business Permit
  - BIR Certificate (Form 2303)
  - Bank account statement (last 3 months)
  - Government ID of authorized representative
- [ ] Set realistic launch date: 4 weeks AFTER approval
- [ ] Maintain sandbox testing throughout development

**Owner:** Business Operations  
**Timeline:** IMMEDIATE (2-4 week lead time)

---

#### 3. Epic 1.5 Completion Status Unclear
**Location:** Section 6 - Feature Sequencing & Dependencies  
**Issue:** Epic 2 depends on Epic 1.5 but completion status not confirmed
- Story 1.5.10 (Premium Sidebar Integration) required for upgrade prompts
- Database schema from Epic 1 required
- Auth.js session management must be working

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] CONFIRM Epic 1.5 completion status with Dev (James)
- [ ] If incomplete: Prioritize Story 1.5.10 completion
- [ ] If complete: Document Epic 1.5 sign-off
- [ ] Run integration smoke tests before Epic 2
- [ ] Block Epic 2 story creation until Epic 1.5 verified

**Owner:** Product Owner (Sarah) + Dev (James)  
**Timeline:** Before story creation

---

### üü° HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### 4. Rollback Strategy Incomplete
**Location:** Section 7.2 - Risk Management  
**Issue:** No operationalized rollback procedures
- Feature flags not documented
- Rollback triggers undefined

**Recommendation:**
Add to Story 2.1 Dev Notes:
1. Implement feature flag: `ENABLE_PREMIUM_PAYMENTS` (default: false)
2. Define rollback triggers:
   - Payment success rate <85%
   - Webhook failure rate >10%
   - Critical security vulnerability
3. Document rollback procedure:
   - Disable feature flag
   - Deactivate Xendit webhook
   - Database rollback script available

**Owner:** Architect (Winston) + Dev (James)

---

#### 5. Regression Testing Strategy Missing
**Location:** Section 2.4 - Testing Infrastructure  
**Issue:** No explicit regression testing for Epic 1.5 features

**Recommendation:**
Add to Story 2.1 Testing section:
1. Regression Test Suite:
   - Epic 1.5.10: Premium gate displays upgrade prompt
   - Epic 1: Auth flow unchanged
   - Epic 1: Free content access unchanged
2. Run before Epic 2 production launch
3. Automated via Playwright if possible

**Owner:** QA (Quinn) + Dev (James)

---

#### 6. User Communication Plan Missing
**Location:** Section 7.3 - User Impact Mitigation  
**Issue:** No plan for announcing premium launch to users

**Recommendation:**
Create User Communication Plan:
1. Email campaign announcing premium launch
2. In-app notification for free users
3. Premium launch blog post
4. Customer support FAQs
5. Social media announcement

**Owner:** Product Manager (John)  
**Timeline:** Week 3 (before launch)

---

#### 7. User-Facing Documentation Missing
**Location:** Section 9.2 - Documentation & Handoff  
**Issue:** No customer FAQs or help documentation for payments

**Recommendation:**
Create before launch:
1. Payment FAQs:
   - What payment methods are accepted?
   - How long does verification take?
   - What if my payment fails?
   - How do I get a refund?
   - When does my subscription expire?
2. Add to help center or docs site
3. Link from payment page

**Owner:** Product Manager (John) or Technical Writer  
**Timeline:** Week 3 (before launch)

---

## BROWNFIELD INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT

### Integration Risk Level: üü° MEDIUM

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Payment system is additive, not modifying existing core features
- ‚úÖ Clear integration points identified (user table, premium gating)
- ‚úÖ Rollback possible via database rollback
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency on Epic 1.5 completion creates uncertainty

### Existing System Impact: ‚úÖ LOW
- Free users unaffected
- Premium upgrade is optional user action
- No existing premium subscribers to migrate

### Integration Confidence Scores

| Aspect | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Preserving Existing Functionality | 85% | üü¢ High |
| Rollback Procedure Completeness | 60% | üü° Medium |
| Monitoring Coverage | 90% | üü¢ High |
| Support Team Readiness | 40% | üî¥ Low |
