nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Webhook signature verification implemented with timing-safe comparison
      ✅ PCI-DSS compliant - no card data stored, hosted checkout only
      ✅ Idempotency checks prevent duplicate payment processing
      ✅ Environment variables properly managed, no hardcoded secrets
      ✅ Input validation on all payment endpoints
      ✅ SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Database indexes on orders(user_id, status, xendit_invoice_id, plan_type)
      ✅ Webhook processing completes in <5 seconds (verified with live testing)
      ✅ Batch processing not required (single-user transactions)
      ✅ No N+1 query issues in payment flow
      ⚠️ Monitoring metrics not yet configured (Task 10 pending)
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      ✅ Webhook retry mechanism via 500 error responses
      ✅ Order status fallback polling implemented
      ✅ Graceful email failure handling (non-blocking)
      ✅ Session refresh fixed - premium access reflects immediately
      ✅ Premium content access working without redirect loops
      ⚠️ No automated test coverage to validate reliability under failure scenarios
      ⚠️ Error tracking not configured for production monitoring
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Service layer abstraction (OrderService, WebhookLogService, UserService)
      ✅ Clear separation of concerns (API routes, business logic, data access)
      ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation with JSDoc
      ✅ Well-structured migration with rollback instructions
      ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
      ✅ Consistent error handling patterns
      ⚠️ Test coverage gaps reduce confidence in future refactoring
