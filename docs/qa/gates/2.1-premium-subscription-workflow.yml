  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive security testing - webhook signature verification (Test 1.2), authentication checks (Test 2.3), idempotency protection (Test 1.3), all 40 webhook verification unit tests passing. PCI-DSS compliance verified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Webhook processing <2s (target <5s), invoice creation ~1-2s, structured logging enables performance monitoring. Non-blocking email failures validated (Test 1.8)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling tested - database errors (Test 1.7), API failures (Test 2.6), validation errors, email service failures. Live testing successful via ngrok."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "98.7% payment test coverage (77/78), clear test architecture, comprehensive documentation, service layer abstraction. Minor technical debt quantified and low-risk."
