review_notes: |
  Re-review conducted after James (Dev Agent) implemented fix for CRITICAL-1535.
  
  The fix properly implements Option A (Server-First Approach) as recommended in the defect report:
  - Server component fetches data once
  - Client component receives data as prop
  - No redundant API calls
  - Better performance with server-side rendering
  
  All acceptance criteria from the defect report have been met:
  ✅ User navigates to concept page and sees full content immediately
  ✅ Content matches database content (verified by test structure)
  ✅ No redundant API calls (verified by dedicated test)
  ✅ Server-rendered approach confirmed
  ✅ All markdown formatting renders correctly (component unchanged)
  ✅ Navigation between concepts works (tested)
  ✅ No errors in compilation or linting
  
  The implementation quality is excellent. The fix not only resolves the critical defect
  but also improves the overall architecture by following Next.js 15 best practices.
  
  Gate Decision: PASS - Story is now ready for production deployment.
