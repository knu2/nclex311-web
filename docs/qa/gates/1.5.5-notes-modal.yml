    Component tests (28): Comprehensive coverage of rendering, loading, editing, auto-save, manual save, delete, accessibility
    Missing: Service layer unit tests, API integration tests (recommended but not blocking)
    Test categories: Rendering (5), Loading (5), Editing (7), Auto-save (3), Manual save (2), Delete (2), Accessibility (4)

architecture_notes: |
  Follows Story 1.4.1 patterns correctly:
  - NotesService extends BaseService
  - Singleton connection via getConnection() (optimal - no per-request cleanup needed)
  - ServiceError for error handling
  - executeOperation wrapper for database operations
  - Schema-driven TypeScript types (Note, NewNote, NoteUpdate)
  
  Clean layered architecture:
  - Schema layer: Drizzle pgTable with proper relations, unique index
  - Service layer: CRUD methods with validation and error handling
  - API layer: RESTful endpoints with authentication and Zod validation
  - Component layer: React with hooks, MUI, accessibility, auto-save
