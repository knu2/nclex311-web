  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Logo loaded from local directory, no XSS vectors, no sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance impact. CSS Grid changes are efficient, SVG logo is 31KB. Build time unaffected."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Build successful. Visual-only changes with no business logic affected. No data model changes."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code is clean and maintainable. Minor concern: 62 pre-existing TypeScript errors in test files need attention in separate story."
