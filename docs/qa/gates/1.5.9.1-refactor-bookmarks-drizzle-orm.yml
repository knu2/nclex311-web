# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All API endpoints require authentication, ownership verification in removeBookmark, no SQL injection risk with Drizzle ORM parameterized queries, foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Indexes on userId and conceptId for fast lookups, efficient joins in getUserBookmarks (single query vs N+1), connection cleanup via BaseService.executeOperation(), performance maintained or improved vs Supabase implementation"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with ServiceError, graceful degradation for edge cases (duplicates, not found), 43/43 tests passing, zero breaking changes verified"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Schema-driven types eliminate manual duplication, follows established service layer pattern, comprehensive JSDoc documentation, clean separation of concerns, consistent with Story 1.4.1 and 1.5.6.1 patterns"
