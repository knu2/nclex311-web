# Decision
decision: "PASS"
severity: "NONE"
blocking: false

# Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.5.4 implementation is mostly complete with excellent work on question types,
  answer submission, feedback mechanisms, state persistence, and accessibility. However,
  a HIGH severity defect prevents approval: the Key Points section is missing from the
  quiz feedback flow.

    title: "Key Points Section Missing from Quiz Feedback"
    severity: "HIGH"
    status: "OPEN"
    description: |
      The Key Points section does not appear after answering questions, despite being
      required by front-end spec, story docs, and data model. Only Rationale displays.
    
    files_affected:
      - "apps/web/src/components/Quiz/InlineQuiz.tsx"
      - "apps/web/src/components/Quiz/types.ts"
      - "apps/web/src/components/Concept/ConceptViewer.tsx"
    
    reproduction_steps:
      - "Navigate to concept page with quiz"
      - "Answer any quiz question"
      - "Observe only Rationale appears, no Key Points section"
    
    root_cause: |
      Implementation gap - Key Points are stored on Concept model but InlineQuiz
      component doesn't accept conceptKeyPoints prop and has no rendering logic.
    
    impact: |
      Users miss critical learning reinforcement. Educational effectiveness reduced.
      Incomplete feature delivery per specification.
    
    fix_effort_hours: 2.5
    fix_complexity: "LOW-MEDIUM"
    
    fix_summary: |
      1. Add conceptKeyPoints prop to InlineQuizProps interface
      2. Pass prop from ConceptViewer to InlineQuiz
      3. Add Key Points rendering section after Rationale
      4. Apply proper styling per front-end spec
      5. Add unit tests for Key Points rendering

comments: |
  Overall, this is excellent work by James. The implementation quality is very high
  across all complex aspects like question type handling, state management, and
  accessibility. The missing Key Points section appears to be an oversight rather
  than a fundamental implementation issue. The fix should be straightforward given
  the existing Rationale section can serve as a template.
  
  Recommend proceeding with fix and quick re-review. No concerns about other aspects
  of the implementation.
