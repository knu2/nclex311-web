  notes: |
    Unit tests (21): All service methods covered with mocks - validation, error handling, edge cases
    Integration tests (24): Real database operations - CRUD, likes, pagination, performance, constraints
    Test level appropriateness: Optimal split between unit and integration
    Tests skip gracefully when DATABASE_URL not configured

architecture_notes: |
  The implementation uses a singleton connection pattern (getConnection()) which returns a 
  global database connection with built-in pooling (max: 20, idle_timeout: 30s, SSL: require).
  This is optimal architecture because:
  - No per-service cleanup needed (services share the global connection)
  - Connection pool automatically manages lifecycle
  - More efficient than per-service pools (reduces overhead)
  - Follows established pattern from Story 1.4.1
