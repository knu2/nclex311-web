# üîÑ **Sprint Change Proposal**
## **UX Enhancement Pivot - Epic 1.5 Integration**

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Proposal ID:** SCP-2025-001  
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED  
**Author:** BMad Orchestrator (Correct Course Task)

---

## 1. Identified Issue Summary

### **Issue Statement**

The approved UX mockup (`scratchpad/sample_chapter_demo_v23.html`) introduces a fundamentally different interaction model (sidebar-based navigation with persistent context) that makes the UI components from Story 1.6 obsolete and requires Story 1.6.1 to be reimplemented for the new layout. The mockup also introduces 5 new features (Notes Modal, Discussion Modal, All Chapters View, Progress Dashboard, Bookmarks View) that were not in Epic 1's original scope.

### **Trigger Classification**

- ‚úÖ **Necessary pivot based on feedback/new information** (approved mockup)
- ‚úÖ **Newly discovered requirements** (5 new features)
- Partially **fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements** (dashboard-centric was assumed correct)

### **Date Identified:** 2025-10-01  
**Triggering Stories:** 1.6 (Done), 1.6.1 (Approved but not implemented*), 1.7 (Not created)

**Critical Note:** *Story 1.6.1 has uncommitted implementation code that needs evaluation.

## 2. Epic Impact Summary

### **Epic 1: Foundation & Freemium Experience**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend Complete, ‚ö†Ô∏è UI Layer Superseded
